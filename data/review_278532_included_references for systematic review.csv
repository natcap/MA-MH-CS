Urban green space and happiness in developed countries,"Kwon, OH; Hong, I; Yang, J; Wohn, DY; Jung, WS; Cha, M","Urban green space is thought to contribute to citizen happiness by promoting physical and mental health. Nevertheless, how urban green space and happiness are related across many countries with different socioeconomic conditions has not been explored. By measuring the urban green space score (UGS) from high-resolution satellite imagery of 90 global cities covering 179,168 km(2) and 230 million people in 60 developed countries, we find that the amount of urban green space and GDP are correlated with a nation's happiness level. More specifically, urban green space and GDP are each individually associated with happiness. Yet, only urban green space is related to happiness in the 30 wealthiest countries, whereas GDP alone can explain happiness in the subsequent 30 countries in terms of wealth. We further show that the relationship between urban green space and happiness is mediated by social support and that GDP moderates this relationship. These findings corroborate the importance of maintaining urban green space as a place for social cohesion to support people's happiness.",2021,,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,10,1,,WOS:000656076000001,10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00278-7,,#3,Kwon 2021,
Residential green space quantity and quality and symptoms of psychological distress: a 15-year longitudinal study of 3897 women in postpartum,"Feng, XQ; Astell-Burt, T","Background: Experiments and large-scale epidemiological studies indicate the importance of green space for mental health. However, little research has been conducted to elucidate whether these mental health benefits are more dependent upon the quantity or quality of the green space.Methods: Symptoms of psychological distress were measured in 3897 women who did not change neighbourhood up to 15 years postpartum using the Kessler 6 psychological distress scale from 2004 onwards. The percentage land-use of the neighbourhood was used to ascertain a measure of green space quantity. A Likert scale was used to measure green space quality in response to the statement ""there are good parks, playgrounds and play spaces in this neighbourhood."" Multilevel negative binomial growth curve regression models were used to examine the patterning of symptoms of psychological distress across the postpartum period in relation to green space quantity and quality, adjusting for person-level and geographical markers of confounding. The same variables were also fitted in multilevel logistic regressions to examine the odds of reporting serious mental illness (as defined by K6 scores >= 13 out of 24).Results: Symptoms of psychological distress were fewer among women who agreed (rate ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98) and strongly agreed (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.93) local parks were good quality. The odds of reporting serious mental illness were also lower among women who agreed (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.00) and strongly agreed (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86) local parks were good quality. No association was found between green space quantity and symptoms of psychological distress or the odds of reporting serious mental illness.Conclusions: This study suggests it may be how mothers perceive green space nearby and what those spaces enable them to do, rather than simply how much there is overall, that is important for promoting mental health in the postpartum period. In conclusion, community consultation is likely to be a crucial part of strategies that maximise the health benefits of urban greening for everyone.",2018,,BMC PSYCHIATRY,18,,,WOS:000460056200001,10.1186/s12888-018-1926-1,,#6,Feng 2018,
Residential green space in childhood is associated with lower risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood,"Engemann, K; Pedersen, CB; Arge, L; Tsirogiannis, C; Mortensen, PB; Svenning, JC","Urban residence is associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders, but the underlying drivers remain unknown. There is increasing evidence that the level of exposure to natural environments impacts mental health, but few large-scale epidemiological studies have assessed the general existence and importance of such associations. Here, we investigate the prospective association between green space and mental health in the Danish population. Green space presence was assessed at the individual level using high-resolution satellite data to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index within a 210 x 210 m square around each person's place of residence (similar to 1 million people) from birth to the age of 10. We show that high levels of green space presence during childhood are associated with lower risk of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders later in life. Risk for subsequent mental illness for those who lived with the lowest level of green space during childhood was up to 55% higher across various disorders compared with those who lived with the highest level of green space. The association remained even after adjusting for urbanization, socioeconomic factors, parental history of mental illness, and parental age. Stronger association of cumulative green space presence during childhood compared with single-year green space presence suggests that presence throughout childhood is important. Our results show that green space during childhood is associated with better mental health, supporting efforts to better integrate natural environments into urban planning and childhood life.",2019,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,116,11,5188-5193,WOS:000460911500068,10.1073/pnas.1807504116,,#7,Engemann 2019,
"Noncommunicable Diseases, Park Prescriptions, and Urban Green Space Use Patterns in a Global South Context: The Case of Dhaka, Bangladesh","Labib, SM; Shuvo, FK; Browning, MHEM; Rigolon, A","Urban green space use is often associated with improved physical and mental health and lower noncommunicable disease (NCDs) burdens. Factors that influence green space visits have been documented in cities of the Global North, but evidence of urban green space use patterns for cities in the Global South is scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate factors influencing urban green space use patterns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a megacity of the Global South, with a particular focus on how poor health condition and healthcare professionals' prescriptions to exercise outdoors (park prescriptions-ParkRx) impact the green space use of middle-aged adults. We collected green space characteristics and use factors (i.e., availability, accessibility, attractiveness, and attachment), health condition, ParkRx, and urban green space use intensity (i.e., frequency and duration) via a self-reported questionnaire from 169 middle-aged residents of Dhaka. We used multivariate modeling to estimate the association of green space characteristics, health condition, and ParkRx with use intensity. We further applied a mediation analysis to determine the influence of ParkRx on the relationship between residents' poor health conditions and use intensity. We found that green space availability and accessibility did not significantly influence use intensity, but attractiveness was negatively associated with use intensity. Green space use intensity was significantly and positively associated with attachment to the green space, poor health condition (i.e., having noncommunicable diseases), and ParkRx. ParkRx significantly mediated the relationship between health condition and use intensity. We observed limited supply, poor access, and low attractiveness when studying the urban green spaces in Dhaka, but these qualities did not affect use intensity, as found in many case studies in the Global North. In contrast, urban green space use intensity in our case study is mostly dependent on poor health condition and park prescriptions.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,17,11,,WOS:000542629600153,10.3390/ijerph17113900,,#10,Labib 2020,
Would You Be Happier Living in a Greener Urban Area? A Fixed-Effects Analysis of Panel Data,"White, MP; Alcock, I; Wheeler, BW; Depledge, MH","Urbanization is a potential threat to mental health and well-being. Cross-sectional evidence suggests that living closer to urban green spaces, such as parks, is associated with lower mental distress. However, earlier research was unable to control for time-invariant heterogeneity (e.g., personality) and focused on indicators of poor psychological health. The current research advances the field by using panel data from over 10,000 individuals to explore the relation between urban green space and well-being (indexed by ratings of life satisfaction) and between urban green space and mental distress (indexed by General Health Questionnaire scores) for the same people over time. Controlling for individual and regional covariates, we found that, on average, individuals have both lower mental distress and higher well-being when living in urban areas with more green space. Although effects at the individual level were small, the potential cumulative benefit at the community level highlights the importance of policies to protect and promote urban green spaces for well-being.",2013,,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,24,6,920-928,WOS:000320026000012,10.1177/0956797612464659,,#12,White 2013,
"Public green spaces and positive mental health - investigating the relationship between access, quantity and types of parks and mental wellbeing","Wood, L; Hooper, P; Foster, S; Bull, F","Associations between parks and mental health have typically been investigated in relation to the presence or absence of mental illness. This study uses a validated measure of positive mental health and data from RESIDential Environments (RESIDE) Project to investigate the association between the presence, amount and attributes of public green space in new greenfield neighbourhood developments and the mental health of local residents (n = 492). Both the overall number and total area of public green spaces were significantly associated with greater mental wellbeing, and findings support a dose-response relationship. Positive mental health was not only associated with parks with a nature focus, but also with green spaces characterised by recreational and sporting activity. The study demonstrates that adequate provision of public green space in local neighbourhoods and within walking distance is important for positive mental health.",2017,,HEALTH & PLACE,48,,63-71,WOS:000414855600008,10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.09.002,,#14,Wood 2017,
The Contribution to Stress Recovery and Attention Restoration Potential of Exposure to Urban Green Spaces in Low-Density Residential Areas,"Huang, SP; Qi, JD; Li, W; Dong, JW; van den Bosch, CK","This study assessed the contributions of urban green spaces on mental health with joint consideration of people's physiological and psychological responses. The psychological and physiological responses of participants aged between 22 and 28, who visited green spaces in a low-density area of Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China, were measured using Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) methods and biometric wearable sensing devices, respectively. Results showed that exposure to green space led to significant changes in PRS, electrodermal activity (EDA), facial electromyography (EMG), respiration sensor (RESP), and photoplethysmography (PPG), while there is no significant impact on skin temperature (SKT). Additionally, psychological and physiological responses were highly consistent and correlated (R < 0.8). The results also indicated that green spaces with high plant species richness, a water landscape, bumpy ground, cultural landscape, and without roadways presented a high performance on stress recovery and attention restoration. At the same time, the influence of openness was negligible in the low-density area. The study provides planners and landscape designers with specific guidance for implementing urban green spaces to improve mental health in low-density residential areas.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,16,,WOS:000690646600001,10.3390/ijerph18168713,,#19,Huang 2021,
Green Space for Mental Health in the COVID-19 Era: A Pathway Analysis in Residential Green Space Users,"Li, H; Browning, MHEM; Dzhambov, AM; Zhang, GD; Cao, Y","Residential green space is among the most accessible types of urban green spaces and may help maintain mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is insufficiently understood how residents use residential green space for exercise during the epidemic. The pathways between residential green space and mental health also merit further exploration. Therefore, we conducted an online study among Chinese residents in December 2021 to capture data on engagement with urban green space for green exercise, the frequency of green exercise, perceived pollution in green space, perceptions of residential green space, social cohesion, depression, and anxiety. Among the 1208 respondents who engaged in green exercise last month, 967 (80%) reported that green exercise primarily occurred in residential neighborhoods. The rest (20%) reported that green exercise occurred in more distant urban green spaces. The most common reasons that respondents sought green exercise in urban green spaces were better air and environmental qualities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then employed to explore the pathways between the perceived greenness of residential neighborhoods and mental health among respondents who used residential green space for exercise. The final model suggested that residential green space was negatively associated with anxiety (beta = -0.30, p = 0.001) and depression (beta = -0.33, p < 0.001), mainly through indirect pathways. Perceived pollution and social cohesion were the two mediators that contributed to most of the indirect effects. Perceived pollution was also indirectly associated with green exercise through less social cohesion (beta = -0.04, p = 0.010). These findings suggest a potential framework to understand the mental health benefits of residential green space and its accompanying pathways during the COVID-19 era.",2022,,LAND,11,8,,WOS:000845589400001,10.3390/land11081128,,#20,Li 2022,
Urban green space alone is not enough: A landscape analysis linking the spatial distribution of urban green space to mental health in the city of Chicago,"Ha, J; Kim, HJ; With, KA","Research on the association between urban green space and mental health has largely focused on the presence or quantity of green space, rather than on the spatial distribution of green spaces within the urban landscape. We therefore investigated the relationship between the amount, composition, and spatial distribution of urban green space and the level of psychological distress reported by residents of a large metropolitan city (Chicago, Illinois, USA). We used mental health data collected from 6405 residents in 61 communities by the Chicago Department of Public Health as part of their Healthy Chicago Survey, and quantified landscape metrics related to the amount and configuration of green space within these community 'landscapes'. Using generalized linear mixed models that controlled for socio-economic confounds, we found that residents reported less psychological distress within urban landscapes that had small-sized water bodies and greater distances between forested areas, which tend to characterize the distribution of large forest parks throughout Chicago. In terms of total green space, however, psychological distress levels were lower in landscapes having a disaggregated distribution of urban green spaces (i.e., many small green spaces) relative to a single (or a few) large green spaces. Our study thus highlights that the configuration of urban green space may be as important as the amount of green space to the mental health of urban residents.",2022,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,218,,,WOS:000725593300004,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104309,,#22,Ha 2022,
Green Space Attachment and Health: A Comparative Study in Two Urban Neighborhoods,"Zhang, Y; van Dijk, T; Tang, JJ; van den Berg, AE","The positive relationships between urban green space and health have been well documented. Little is known, however, about the role of residents' emotional attachment to local green spaces in these relationships, and how attachment to green spaces and health may be promoted by the availability of accessible and usable green spaces. The present research aimed to examine the links between self-reported health, attachment to green space, and the availability of accessible and usable green spaces. Data were collected via paper-mailed surveys in two neighborhoods (n = 223) of a medium-sized Dutch city in the Netherlands. These neighborhoods differ in the perceived and objectively measured accessibility and usability of green spaces, but are matched in the physically available amount of urban green space, as well as in demographic and socio-economic status, and housing conditions. Four dimensions of green space attachment were identified through confirmatory factor analysis: place dependence, affective attachment, place identity and social bonding. The results show greater attachment to local green space and better self-reported mental health in the neighborhood with higher availability of accessible and usable green spaces. The two neighborhoods did not differ, however, in physical and general health. Structural Equation Modelling confirmed the neighborhood differences in green space attachment and mental health, and also revealed a positive path from green space attachment to mental health. These findings convey the message that we should make green places, instead of green spaces.",2015,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,12,11,14342-14363,WOS:000365645500048,10.3390/ijerph121114342,,#25,Zhang 2015,
Neural correlates of individual differences in affective benefit of real-life urban green space exposure,"Tost, H; Reichert, M; Braun, U; Reinhard, I; Peters, R; Lautenbach, S; Hoell, A; Schwarz, E; Ebner-Priemer, U; Zipf, A; Meyer-Lindenberg, A","Psychiatric morbidity is high in cities, so identifying potential modifiable urban protective factors is important. We show that exposure to urban green space improves well-being in naturally behaving male and female city dwellers, particularly in districts with higher psychiatric incidence and fewer green resources. Higher green-related affective benefit was related to lower prefrontal activity during negative-emotion processing, which suggests that urban green space exposure may compensate for reduced neural regulatory capacity.",2019,,NATURE NEUROSCIENCE,22,9,1389-+,WOS:000483377100004,10.1038/s41593-019-0451-y,,#26,Tost 2019,
Perceived urban green and residents' health in Beijing,"Xu, JX; Wang, FH; Chen, L; Zhang, WZ","Green space serves urban residents in various functions including promoting health, but the roles of different types of green space are unclear. A survey titled ""Healthy Neighborhood"" was conducted in Beijing from May to July 2019 to examine and compare the associations between three types of perceived green space (park green, public-square green and utility green) and three aspects of residents' health (physical health, mental health and social health). Results from the multilevel modeling (MLM) analysis show that the perceived park green has a positive correlation with mental health, and all three types of perceived green space correlate with social health positively. No significant correlation of any type of green space is detected on participants' physical health, nor any relation of public-square green or utility green to their mental health. Overall the role of urban green space is stronger on social health than physical and mental health. The findings support the complementary roles of different types of green space, and suggest that expansion in utility greens could be as effective as investing in more costly park and public-square greens, especially in their benefit in promoting social health.",2021,,SSM-POPULATION HEALTH,14,,,WOS:000661125200030,10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100790,,#32,Xu 2021,
"Understanding the relationship between small urban parks and mental health: A case study in Shanghai, China","Wang, PW; Han, LR; Hao, RS; Mei, R","The literature to date has mainly explored the impact on public mental health of green spaces around residential areas, large urban parks, family gardens, blue spaces, national parks, etc., while few studies have examined the association of Small Urban Green Spaces (SUGS) with public mental health. The role, function, and service radius of SUGS in urban people's lives are quite different from those of general green spaces, and the relationship and mechanism linking general green spaces to mental health cannot be fully applied to small parks. This work was conducted to: 1) investigate the relationship between SUGS and mental health; 2) understand what factors affect mental health; 3) determine what kind of SUGS is more conducive to improving mental health. SUGS' designs and physical characteristics were evaluated with the Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST) and user in-formation for 10 SUGS (1-5 ha) in Shanghai in 2021 was collected via a questionnaire. We developed a multilevel model for exploring the factors affecting mental health from two aspects: the individual level and the park level. This study found that SUGS and mental health were positively associated. In addition to individu-al-level variables like income, marital status, social cohesion, and use frequency, park-level variables such as usability, aesthetics-natural features, and civilized environment are also conducive to improving mental health, while entertainment facilities in SUGS have a negative association with mental health. There was no evidence that visit frequency, stay time, social cohesion, or physical exercise act as a mediator between park features and mental health. This study provides empirical evidence for the positive correlation between SUGS and mental health and presents a means of promoting public mental health with efficient SUGS planning and management.",2022,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,78,,,WOS:000885936300001,10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127784,,#38,Wang 2022,
Do Sociodemographic Factors and Urban Green Space Affect Mental Health Outcomes Among the Urban Elderly Population?,"Lee, HJ; Lee, DK","The mounting mental health issues faced by elderly urban residents increase the social and economic costs to society associated with dementia and depression. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the characteristics of elderly urban residents suffering from mental health issues, to address these issues more effectively. We used 2015 Community Health Survey data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the demographic and social characteristics of 11,408 elderly urban residents in relation to stress levels and symptoms of depression in seven metropolitan areas in Korea, and to calculate the odds ratio for urban green space. We found that the prevalence of these mental health issues generally decreased in relation to the ratio of green space of an area. These findings suggest identifying elderly people who are vulnerable to certain mental health issues based on demographic and social characteristics and demonstrate that the ratio of urban green space within a community is an important component in improving mental health outcomes for elderly urban residents. These findings have policy implications for assisting elderly people vulnerable to certain mental health issues and for establishing a green welfare policy targeting this population.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,5,,WOS:000462664200114,10.3390/ijerph16050789,,#47,Lee 2019,
Access to urban green spaces and behavioural problems in children: Results from the GINIplus and LISAplus studies,"Markevych, I; Tiesler, CMT; Fuertes, E; Romanos, M; Dadvand, P; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ; Berdel, D; Koletzko, S; Heinrich, J","Aim: We investigated whether objectively measured access to urban green spaces is associated with behavioural problems in 10-year old children living in Munich and its surrounding areas.Methods: Behavioural problems were assessed in the GINIplus and LISAplus 10-year follow-up between 2006 and 2009 using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Access to green spaces was defined using the distance from a child's residence to the nearest urban green space. Associations between access to urban green spaces and behavioural problems were assessed using proportional odds and logistic regression models in 1932 children with complete exposure, outcome and covariate data.Results: The distance between a child's residence and the nearest urban green space was positively associated with the odds of hyperactivity/inattention, especially among children with abnormal values compared to children with borderline or normal values (odds ratio (OR) = 1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.42) per 500 m increase in distance). When stratified by sex, this association was only statistically significant among males. Children living further than 500 m away from urban green spaces had more overall behavioural problems than those living within 500 m of urban green spaces (proportional OR = 1.41 (95% CI = 1.06-1.87)). Behavioural problems were not associated with the distance to forests or with residential surrounding greenness.Conclusion: Poor access to urban green spaces was associated with behavioural problems in 10-year old children. Results were most consistent with hyperactivity/inattention problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Associations between growing up in natural environments and subsequent psychiatric disorders in Denmark,"Engemann, K; Svenning, JC; Arge, L; Brandt, J; Erikstrup, C; Geels, C; Hertel, O; Mortensen, PB; Plana-Ripoll, O; Tsirogiannis, C; Sabel, CE; Sigsgaard, T; Pedersen, CB","Natural environments have been associated with mental health benefits worldwide. However, how different elements and types of natural environments associate with mental health is still largely unknown. In this study, we perform a detailed analysis on a large, nation-wide data set of mental health records (908 553 individuals) for Denmark combined with remotely-sensed land cover and vegetation density data. We explore associations between growing up surrounded by different environments and rates of a spectrum of 18 psychiatric disorders. Childhood land cover exposure for urban, agricultural, near-natural green space, and blue space was determined around the residence of each individual. Vegetation density and air pollution were evaluated as potential pathways. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate rates as hazard ratios and then adjusted for potential confounding from other known risk factors. For 12 of 18 disorders, rates were lower for children growing up in environments with more natural elements (near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture) compared to children growing up in urban environments. High vegetation density was associated with lower rates for most disorders within all the examined environments, whereas mitigation of air pollution by natural environments seemed a less important potential pathway. Rates were not notably changed by adjustment for urbanization, parental and municipal socioeconomic status, family history of mental illness, and parents' age. In conclusion, we found that growing up surrounded by a range of natural environments such as near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture may lower rates of psychiatric disorders.

Research note: Natural environments and prescribing in England,"Gidlow, CJ; Smith, G; Martinez, D; Wilson, R; Trinder, P; Grazuleviciene, R; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ","Studies using routinely gathered data increasingly show associations between area-level green space and health. However, the environment exposure measures often include only urban green space and there has been limited use of prescribing data as a proxy health indicator. This brief report presents a small-area ecological study of associations between natural environment (including private gardens and water) and the volume and cost of prescribing for cardiovascular conditions and depression in England, with confirmatory analysis using all-cause mortality (in adults aged 15-65 years). Using Besag, York and Mollie (BYM) models to adjust for known confounders and unaccounted-for spatial autocorrelation, we found a statistically significant association of lower mortality in areas with higher area density of natural environment, which was strongest in more deprived areas. There was some evidence of a positive association between cardiovascular prescribing and area density of natural environment, with a nonsignificant trend towards lower anti-depressant prescribing in areas with higher natural environment density. Apparently beneficial relationships between all cause mortality and natural environment were not observed for prescribing data, but we advocate further exploration focusing on prescribing for mental health and other conditions with plausible links.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between two types of measurement of urban green space and self-reported lifestyle-related disorders in Oslo, Norway. Methods: Self-reported measures on mental disorders, asthma, type 2 diabetes and musculoskeletal pain of 8638 participants in the Oslo Health Study (HUBRO) were linked to two types of green space variables: the vegetation cover greenness derived from satellite data, which shows the city's vegetation cover regardless of property boundaries, and the land use greenness derived from municipal plans showing information about publicly accessible vegetation-covered areas. Associations between greenness and health measures were analysed by logistic regression models controlling for possible individual and contextual confounders. Results: Increasing vegetation cover greenness was associated with fewer self-reported mental disorders for both men and women after controlling for possible confounders. The proportion of women who reported high levels of musculoskeletal pain increased with increasing degrees of both of the greenness measurements, but no significant association was observed for men. No association was found for asthma and diabetes type 2 for either men or women. Conclusions: Although there was a positive association between vegetation cover greenness and self-reported mental disorders, the main findings showed mixed results.

The effect of green space behaviour and per capita area in small urban green spaces on psychophysiological responses,"Lin, W; Chen, QB; Jiang, MY; Zhang, XX; Liu, ZF; Tao, JY; Wu, LJ; Xu, S; Kang, YS; Zeng, QY","Research has shown that there is a close relationship between small urban green spaces and people's physical and mental health. However, most previous studies focus on the macro-level, and there is a lack of empirical studies using real green spaces as the stimulus. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of two key factors, namely, green space behaviour (GSB) (walking and sitting) and per capita area (PCA) (high, middle and low), in small urban green spaces on the psychophysiological responses of visitors to these spaces. We recruited 240 participants and randomly assigned them to six bamboo-vegetated green spaces with the following different combinations of PCA and GSB: high-sitting, middle-sitting, low-sitting, high-walking, middle-walking and low-walking. The subjects in all six groups performed the same stress tasks indoors (pre-test), then performed green space restoration tasks outdoors (post-test). We measured the participants' beta/alpha index in multiple brain regions, blood pressure, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse. In addition, we performed a Stroop assessment of their attention level, used the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and collected data on green space preference. The results showed that people have better psychophysiological responses when GSB is matched with the appropriate PCA in a small urban green space.

Visits to urban green-space and the countryside associate with different components of mental well-being and are better predictors than perceived or actual local urbanisation intensity,"Coldwell, DF; Evans, KL","Maintaining mental well-being in highly urbanised locations, especially large cities, is challenging but exposure to green-space can promote well-being. We address three poorly resolved questions concerning the relationships between mental health, urbanisation and green-space: i) the relative importance of city size, local intensity of urbanisation and visiting green-space, ii) if visits to urban green-space and the countryside have equivalent associations with well-being, and iii) if biodiversity knowledge moderates relationships between well-being and visiting green-space (such moderation may occur if exposure to biodiversity contributes to relationships between visiting green-space and well-being). We use data from just over 200 respondents recruited in randomised door-to-door surveys across six English cities. We find that visiting green-space increases mental well-being but that city size and the intensity of urbanisation around respondents' homes have negligible influence. The limited effect of local urbanisation holds when considering the perceived amount of greenery or built-up land rather than objectively quantified indices. More frequent visits to the countryside and urban green-space are positively associated with higher well-being scores, but visits to urban green-space are more strongly associated with lower anxiety, whilst countryside visits associate with higher life satisfaction. Biodiversity knowledge did not consistently moderate relationships between well-being and green-space visit rates. Whilst we use a cross-sectional approach our data suggest that mental well-being can be achieved by residents in highly urbanised locations if they frequently access green-space, but achieving high well-being across all its components requires access to the countryside and not just urban green-space.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,175,,114-122,WOS:000431748200011,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.02.007,,#62,Coldwell 2018,
What accounts for 'England's green and pleasant land'? A panel data analysis of mental health and land cover types in rural England,"Alcock, I; White, MP; Lovell, R; Higgins, SL; Osborne, NJ; Husk, K; Wheeler, BW","Exposure to green space is associated with a variety of positive health states. Research to date has focused primarily on 'generic' green space in urban areas, where green space is relatively scarce and where it is dominated by playing fields and parks. The current research adds to our understanding with an examination of relationships between different types of green space and mental health in rural areas in England (approximate rural population = 4 million). The aggregate land cover classes of Land Cover Map 2007 were linked to rural residential areas (Lower-level Super Output Areas) and then linked to rural participants (n = 2020) in the 18-year longitudinal British Household Panel Survey. Random effects regression of mental health (as measured by GHQ12 scores) against land cover enabled effects to be simultaneously estimated from both mean between-individual differences and from within-individual differences over time. The nine natural land cover classes (Broadleaved woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable; Improved grassland; Semi-natural grassland; Mountain, heath and bog; Saltwater; Freshwater; Coastal) were not significantly associated with differences in mental health between individuals. However, significant relationships were observed between some types of land cover and within-individual change in mental health amongst individuals who relocated during the 18 annual waves of the panel. These findings indicate the presence of important health related ecosystem services from different land cover types that have not previously been investigated and which help more effective spatial planning and land use management.

Fixed-effects analyses controlled for time-invariant individual level heterogeneity and other area and individual level effects. Compared to premove mental health scores, individuals who moved to greener areas (n = 594) had significantly better mental health in all three postmove years (P = .015; P = .016; P = .008), supporting a ""shifting baseline"" hypothesis. Individuals who moved to less green areas (n = 470) showed significantly worse mental health in the year preceding the move (P = .031) but returned to baseline in the postmove years.

Role of physical activity in the relationship between urban green space and health,"Richardson, EA; Pearce, J; Mitchell, R; Kingham, S","Objectives: Local availability of green space has been associated with a wide range of health benefits. Possible causative mechanisms underpinning the green space and health relationship include the provision of physical activity opportunities, the stress-relieving effects of nature and the facilitation of social contacts. This study sought to investigate whether urban green space was related to individual-level health outcomes, and whether levels of physical activity were likely to be a mediating factor in any relationships found.Study design: Cross-sectional analysis of anonymized individual health survey responses.Methods: Neighbourhood-level green space availability was linked to 8157 respondents to the New Zealand Health Survey 2006/07 on the basis of their place of residence. Adjusted multilevel models were constructed for four health outcomes which are plausibly related to green space via physical activity: cardiovascular disease; overweight; poor general health; and poor mental health (Short Form 36).Results: The greenest neighbourhoods had the lowest risks of poor mental health [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.00]. Cardiovascular disease risk was reduced in all neighbourhoods with >15% green space availability (e. g. OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 -0.99 for those with 33-70% green space), However, a dose-response relationship was not found. Green space availability was not related to overweight or poor general health. Overall, levels of physical activity were higher in greener neighbourhoods, but adjustment for this only slightly attenuated the green space and health relationships.Conclusions: Neighbourhood green space was related to better cardiovascular and mental health in a New Zealand Health Survey, independent of individual risk factors. Although physical activity was higher in greener neighbourhoods, it did not fully explain the green space and health relationship. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

We aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on maternal mental health and parenting practices.

We explored heterogeneous lockdown effects using longitudinal georeferenced data for 985 families (mothers and 24- to 30-month-olds) and exploiting localized lockdowns in Chile. Controlling for observed and unobserved fixed characteristics, on average, we did not find an association between lockdown duration and maternal mental health or parenting practices. However, the previous nonsignificant association is heterogeneous across access to green space. Although lockdown duration increased dysfunctional interactions with children for mothers with little access to green space, we did not see the previous effect on mothers who live close to green space.

Impact of Frequency of Visits and Time Spent in Urban Green Space on Subjective Well-Being,"Hong, SK; Lee, SW; Jo, HK; Yoo, M","Exposure to green spaces can reduce the negative effects of stress. This study examines how frequency of visits and time spent in urban green spaces (UGS) affect urban dwellers' subjective well-being. We also investigated the numbers of respondents visiting UGS, their primary motivation, and constraints on their ability to visit. Using quota sampling, an online survey was conducted of 400 residents of Daejeon City, South Korea. ANOVA results indicated no significant interactions between visit frequency and time spent in UGS. Respondents who had visited UGS within the past two weeks expressed higher positive and lower negative emotions than did non-visitors, regardless of visit frequency, and regular visitors showed higher general life satisfaction levels. These positive effects were confirmed by estimated structural equation models. However, the time spent in UGS did not affect emotions or life satisfaction in general. Heavy users mostly visited UGS to walk, and light/non-users cited the lack of urban green spaces near their home as the major constraint on visiting UGS. The estimated structural equation models clearly show positive effects from motivation and negative effects of constraints and access time to UGS on visit frequency.

Relative importance of quantitative and qualitative aspects of urban green spaces in promoting health,"Zhang, LQ; Tan, PY; Richards, D","The health benefits of urban green spaces (UGS) are important considerations in the design of urban environments. Researchers have analysed how the quantity of UGS impacts health outcomes, but less work has quantified the relative health benefits of different components of UGS provision. We examined the associations of different indicators of UGS provision with self-reported mental and general health based on a national representative household survey (n = 1000) in Singapore. We quantified three quantitative attributes of UGS (vegetation cover, canopy cover, park area) using Geographic Information System (GIS) data and measured visual greenness using the Green View Index (GVI) based on Google Street View panoramic images. We measured the subjective attributes of UGS, namely, usage quality and quantity of UGS within a 400 m circular buffer zone of residences using the survey. Among all the UGS indicators at the 400 m scale, only canopy cover and perceived usage quality were significantly associated with positive mental health, whereas none of the UGS indicators were related to general health. For visual greenness at different distance scales, there was a significant relationship between the indicator calculated by the sum of GVI at a 100 m scale and mental health. Canopy cover at a 400 m scale had a stronger correlation with mental health than perceived usage quality of nearby UGS and visual greenness at a 100 m scale. The findings highlight the importance of measuring both objective and subjective attributes of UGS provision and provide useful information for urban greening.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,213,,,WOS:000654110100001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104131,,#82,Zhang 2021,
Associations between Urban Green Spaces and Health are Dependent on the Analytical Scale and How Urban Green Spaces are Measured,"Zhang, LQ; Tan, PY","Although the benefits from exposure to urban green spaces (UGS) are increasingly reported, there are important knowledge gaps in the nature of UGS-health relationships. One such unknown area is the dependence of UGS-health associations on the types of UGS studied, the way they are quantified, and the spatial scale used in the analysis. These knowledge gaps have important ramifications on our ability to develop generalizations to promote implementation and facilitate comparative studies across different socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts. We conducted a study in Singapore to examine the dependence of UGS-health associations on the metrics for quantifying UGS (vegetation cover, canopy cover and park area) in different types of buffer area (circular, nested and network) at different spatial scales. A population-based household survey (n = 1000) was used to collect information on self-reported health and perception and usage pattern of UGS. The results showed that although all three UGS metrics were positively related to mental health at certain scales, overall, canopy cover showed the strongest associations with mental health at most scales. There also appears to be minimum and maximum threshold levels of spatial scale at which UGS and health have significant associations, with the strongest associations consistently shown between 400 m to 1600 m in different buffer types. We discuss the significance of these results for UGS-health studies and applications in UGS planning for improved health of urban dwellers.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,4,,WOS:000460804900057,10.3390/ijerph16040578,,#83,Zhang 2019,
Effect of changes in green spaces on mental health in older adults: a fixed effects analysis,"Noordzij, JM; Beenackers, MA; Groeniger, JO; Van Lenthe, FJ","Background Urban green spaces have been linked to different health benefits, but longitudinal studies on the effect of green spaces on mental health are sparse and evidence often inconclusive. Our objective was to study the effect of changes in green spaces in the residential environment on changes in mental health using data with 10years of follow-up (2004-2014).Methods Data from 3175 Dutch adults were linked to accessibility and availability measures of green spaces at three time points (2004/2011/2014). Mental health was measured with the Mental Health Inventory-5. Fixed effects analyses were performed to assess the effect of changes in green spaces on mental health.Results Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data showed significant associations between Euclidean distances to the nearest green space and mental health, with an increase of 100 m correlating with a lower mental health score of approximately 0.5 (95% CI -0.87 to -0.12) on a 0-100 scale. Fixed effects models showed no evidence for associations between changes in green spaces and changes in mental health both for the entire sample as well as for those that did not relocate during follow-up.Conclusions Despite observed cross-sectional correlations between the accessibility of green space in the residential environment and mental health, no evidence was found for an association between changes in green spaces and changes in mental health. If mental health and green spaces are indeed causally linked, then changes in green spaces in the Eindhoven area between 2004 and 2014 are not enough to produce a significant effect.",2020,,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,74,1,48-56,WOS:000506216600009,10.1136/jech-2019-212704,,#88,Noordzij 2020,
Psychosocial Outcomes as Motivations for Visiting Nearby Urban Green Spaces,"Home, R; Hunziker, M; Bauer, N","High-density urban living means that urban green spaces are important nodes of contact with nature.

A sample of Swiss residents were presented with Shin, Kwon, Hammitt, and Kim's (2005) psychosocial outcomes scale and asked which activities they choose to undertake in nearby natural areas. The most important motivations for visiting nearby green spaces were related to restoration, with social bonding as a desirable side benefit. There were few observable differences between urban and rural residents and level of education attained. Older people are motivated to visit nearby green spaces by the wish to seek social contact while younger people are motivated by the wish to seek escape and to reflect.

"Mental Health of Young Australians during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Roles of Employment Precarity, Screen Time, and Contact with Nature","Oswald, TK; Rumbold, AR; Kedzior, SGE; Kohler, M; Moore, VM","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is widely understood to have contributed to mental health problems. In Australia, young people (18-24 years) have been disproportionately affected. To date, research has predominantly focused on the presence or absence of mental illness symptoms, while aspects of mental well-being have been overlooked. We aimed to explore associations between potential risk and protective factors and mental health more comprehensively, using the Complete State Model of Mental Health. An online survey of 1004 young Australians (55% female; M age = 21.23) was undertaken. Assessment of both mental illness and mental well-being enabled participants to be cross-classified into four mental health states. Those with 'Floundering' (13%) or 'Struggling' (47.5%) mental health reported symptoms of mental illness; a 'Languishing' group (25.5%) did not report symptoms of mental illness but mental well-being was compromised relative to those who were 'Flourishing' (14%) with high mental well-being. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine associations, adjusting for socio-demographic confounders. Protective factors associated with Flourishing mental health included being in secure employment, using screen time to connect with others, and reporting high levels of hope. Both incidental and purposive contact with nature were also associated with Flourishing, while a lack of green/bluespace within walking distance was associated with Languishing, absence of outdoor residential space was associated with Floundering, and lower neighbourhood greenness was associated with all three suboptimal mental health states. Precarious employment, financial stress, living alone, reporting decreased screen time during lockdowns, lower levels of hope, and high disruption of core beliefs were also associated with Struggling and Floundering mental health. Those who were Languishing reported somewhat less hardship and little disruption to core beliefs, but lower levels of hope compared to young people who were Flourishing. This study highlights that young adults require dedicated mental health services to deal with current burden, but should also be supported through a range of preventive strategies which target mental health risk factors, like precarious employment, and enhance protective factors, such as urban green infrastructure.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,11,,WOS:000660023100001,10.3390/ijerph18115630,,#96,Oswald 2021,
The Mental Health Benefits of Purposeful Activities in Public Green Spaces in Urban and Semi-Urban Neighbourhoods: A Mixed-Methods Pilot and Proof of Concept Study,"Coventry, PA; Neale, C; Dyke, A; Pateman, R; Cinderby, S","Access and exposure to public green space might be critical to health promotion and prevention of mental ill health. However, it is uncertain if differential health and mental health benefits are associated with undertaking different activities in public green space. We evaluated the health and wellbeing benefits of different activities in different locations of public green spaces in urban and semi-urban areas. We used a mixed-methods before-and-after design. Volunteers at three conservation sites were recruited and took part in group guided walks, practical conservation tasks or citizen science. Repeated measures one-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni correction assessed the relationship between location and activity type on change in acute subjective mood from pre- to post-activity, measured with the UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist (UWIST-MACL). Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken and analysed thematically to explore participants' perceptions about the health and wellbeing benefits of activities in public green space. Forty-five participants were recruited, leading to 65 independent observations. Walking, conservation and citizen science in public green space were associated with improved mood. Across all participants acute subjective mood improved across all domains of the UWIST-MACL. There was a significant association between reduction in stress and location (p = 0.009).

"Deciphering the Link Between Mental Health and Green Space in Shenzhen, China: The Mediating Impact of Residents' Satisfaction","Qiao, YH; Chen, ZN; Chen, YQ; Zheng, TX","Rapid urbanization and increasing urban density in China threaten residents' mental health. As a vital component of built environments, green space plays a key role in individuals' psychological well-being; however, the mediating effect of residents' satisfaction with the green space environment on the relationship between urban greening and residents' mental health in Chinese contexts has yet to be thoroughly explored. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper attempts to reveal the internal logic and mechanism underlying the linkages between green space, residents' mental health, and their satisfaction with green space in Shenzhen, China. Specifically, this paper explores the mediating role of residents' satisfaction with a green space environment using questionnaire survey data, ""Quick Bird-2"" high-resolution remote sensing image data, and a multilevel regression model. Our empirical findings indicate that the relative range of neighboring green spaces can directly improve residents' mental health. More importantly, the relationship between the relative scope of green space and residents' mental health is mediated by residents' satisfaction with the green space environment rather than its direct health effects. Given the influence of green space on residents' satisfaction with the environment, green space indirectly affects mental health. These findings should provide the government useful guidance for considering the spatial distribution and quantity of green space.

Multiple pathways link urban green- and bluespace to mental health in young adults,"Dzhambov, AM; Markevych, I; Hartig, T; Tilov, B; Arabadzhiev, Z; Stoyanov, D; Gatseva, P; Dimitrova, DD","Background: A growing body of scientific literature indicates that urban green- and bluespace support mental health; however, little research has attempted to address the complexities in likely interrelations among the pathways through which benefits plausibly are realized.Objectives: The present study examines how different plausible pathways between green/bluespace and mental health can work together. Both objective and perceived measures of green- and bluespace are used in these models.Methods: We sampled 720 students from the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Residential greenspace was measured in terms of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), tree cover density, percentage of green areas, and Euclidean distance to the nearest green space. Bluespace was measured in terms of its presence in the neighborhood and the Euclidean distance to the nearest bluespace. Mental health was measured with the 12-item form of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The following mediators were considered: perceived neighborhood green/bluespace, restorative quality of the neighborhood, social cohesion, physical activity, noise and air pollution, and environmental annoyance. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to analyze the data.Results: Higher NDVI within a 300 m buffer around the residence was associated with better mental health through higher perceived greenspace; through higher perceived greenspace, leading to increased restorative quality, and subsequently to increased physical activity (i.e., serial mediation); through lower noise exposure, which in turn was associated with lower annoyance; and through higher perceived greenspace, which was associated with lower annoyance. Presence of bluespace within a 300 m buffer did not have a straightforward association with mental health owing to competitive indirect paths: one supporting mental health through higher perceived bluespace, restorative quality, and physical activity; and another engendering mental ill-health through higher noise exposure and annoyance.Conclusions: We found evidence that having more greenspace near the residence supported mental health through several indirect pathways with serial components. Conversely, bluespace was not clearly associated with mental health.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,166,,223-233,WOS:000445318200025,10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.004,,#107,Dzhambov 2018,
Exposure to urban green space may both promote and harm mental health in socially vulnerable neighborhoods: A neighborhood-scale analysis in New York City,"Yoo, EH; Roberts, JE; Eum, Y; Li, XJ; Konty, K","Background: There is growing evidence that exposure to green space can impact mental health, but these effects may be context dependent. We hypothesized that associations between residential green space and mental health can be modified by social vulnerability. Method: We conducted an ecological cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the effects of green space exposure on mental disorder related emergency room (ER) visits in New York City at the level of census tract. To objectively represent green space exposure at the neighborhood scale, we calculated three green space exposure metrics, namely proximity to the nearest park, percentage of green space, and visibility of greenness. Using Bayesian hierarchical spatial Poisson regression models, we evaluated neighborhood social vulnerability as a potential modifier of greenness-mental disorder associations, while accounting for the spatially correlated structures. Results: We found significant associations between green space exposure (involving both proximity and visibility) and total ER visits for mental disorders in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability, but no significant associations in neighborhoods with low social vulnerability. We also identified specific neighborhoods with particularly high ER utilization for mental disorders. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that exposure to green space is associated with ER visits for mental disorders, but that neighborhood social vulnerability can modify this association.

The sample was restricted to residents of urban areas who remained within their neighbourhoods for at least 12 months. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire and confounders were reported for 29 626 male and 35 781 female observations (person-years). This individual-level dataset was linked to a measure of green space availability within each ward of residence. Regression models included age, gender, employment status, household tenure, marital status, education, smoking status and household income.Results When not considering age, green space was associated with better mental health among men, but not women. Interaction terms fitted between age and green space revealed variation in the association between green space and mental health across the lifecourse and by gender. For men, the benefit of more green space emerged in early to mid-adulthood. Among older women, a curvilinear association materialised wherein those with a moderate availability of green space had better mental health.Conclusions These findings illustrate how the relationship between urban green space and health can vary across the lifecourse, and they highlight the need for longitudinal studies to answer why green space may be better for health at some points in the lifecourse than others.",2014,,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,68,6,578-583,WOS:000335362000015,10.1136/jech-2013-203767,,#121,Astell-Burt 2014,
International Chinese Students in the UK: Association between Use of Green Spaces and Lower Stress Levels,"Zhao, S; Patuano, A","The health benefits of urban green spaces have been found to vary for different populations, such as people of different socio-demographics or different cultures. Among these populations, one remains understudied although its numbers are growing: Chinese international students. Indeed, more and more Chinese students choose to go abroad for higher education but face specific challenges, often resulting in them experiencing high levels of stress and poor health. This study explores the link between Chinese international students' use of local green spaces and the effect on their perceived stress and health. An online survey was created to collect data from 186 Chinese international students studying in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK). The data covered the participants' reported health status and their perceived stress levels, the strategies they use when coping with stress, their awareness of the benefits of visiting green spaces as well as their self-reported use of and access to local green spaces. The findings show a significant correlation between access to and use of urban green spaces and the self-reported wellbeing indicators. Some of the barriers experienced by participants in visiting green spaces were also explored. By investigating the specific behaviors of this emerging and vulnerable population, this study expands the corpus of existing evidence for the role played by urban green spaces in supporting wellbeing.

Recently a new 3-30-300 rule of thumb for urban forestry and urban greening has been proposed, but this rule has not been evaluated for benefits on health. The rule requires that every citizen should be able to see at least three trees from their home, have 30 percent tree canopy cover in their neighbourhood and not live more than 300 m away from the nearest park or green space. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the 3-30-300 green space rule and its components in relation to mental health.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on a population-based sample of 3145 individuals aged 15-97 years from in Barcelona, Spain who participated in the Barcelona Health Survey (2016-2017). We created 3-30-300 green space indicators using questionnaire data, GIS, remote sensing and land cover maps. Mental health status was assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and also the use of tran-quilizer/sedatives or antidepressants and psychiatrist or psychologist visits. Analyses were conducted using mixed effects logistic regression models with districts as the random effect, adjusted for relevant covariates.Results: We found that people in Barcelona had relatively little exposure to green space, whether through window view, living in an area with sufficient greenness, or access to a major green space, and only 4.7% met a surrogate 3-30-300 green space rule. Residential surrounding greenness, but not tree window view or access to major green space, was significantly associated with better mental health, less medication use, and fewer psychologist or psychiatrist visits. Meeting the full surrogate 3-30-300 green space rule was associated with better mental health, less medication use, and fewer psychologist or psychiatrist visits, but only for the latter combined the association was statistically significant (Odds ratio = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.91).Conclusion: Few people achieved the 3-30-300 green space in Barcelona and we used a surrogate measure.

Green space and suicide mortality in Japan: An ecological study,"Jiang, WH; Stickley, A; Ueda, M","Although numerous studies have investigated the effect of green space on mental health, as yet, little is known about the association between green space and suicide. To address this deficit, we conducted the first Japan-wide study of the relationship between green space and suicide mortality. Results from spatial analyses of municipality-level panel data for the 1975-2014 period that included 886,440 suicide deaths with a fixed-effect estimator showed that green space was associated with suicide mortality, and that this relationship was conditioned by the form of greenness, level of urbanity and demographic characteristics. In densely populated cities, park density (parks per 1000 of the population) was associated with reduced suicide mortality among females aged 18 and above and among males aged 18 to 39 and aged 65 and above. In small- and medium-sized cities, park coverage (% by area) was linked to fewer suicide deaths among middle-aged and older females (aged 40 and above). In contrast, in non-cities (rural areas), parks were not associated with suicide mortality whereas woodland coverage (% by area) was linked to reduced suicide deaths among middle-aged and older males (aged 40 and above). Our findings suggest that urban green space and rural forest coverage may have a protective effect against self-harming behavior. Future suicide prevention efforts should consider an increased greening of the residential environment in terms of both availability and accessibility, especially with better designs that accommodate population needs and local conditions.",2021,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,282,,,WOS:000679176400005,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114137,,#135,Jiang 2021,
Can Exposure to Certain Urban Green Spaces Trigger Frontal Alpha Asymmetry in the Brain?-Preliminary Findings from a Passive Task EEG Study,"Olszewska-Guizzo, A; Sia, A; Fogel, A; Ho, R","A growing body of evidence from observational and experimental studies shows the associations between exposure to urban green spaces (UGSs) and mental health outcomes. Little is known about which specific features of UGS that might be the most beneficial. In addition, there is potential in utilizing objective physiological markers of mental health, such as assessing brain activity, but the subject requires further investigation. This paper presents the preliminary findings from an on-going within-subject experiment where adult participants (n = 22; 13 females) were passively exposed to six landscape scenes within two UGSs (a park and a neighborhood green space) and three scenes of a busy urban downtown (control site). The landscape scenes were pre-selected based on their contemplative landscape score (CLS) to represent different levels of aggregation of contemplative features within each view. Participants went to each of the sites in a random order to passively view the scenes, while their electroencephalography (EEG) signal was being recorded concurrently. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) values, commonly associated with the approach-related motivation and positive emotions, were extracted. The preliminary results show trends for the main effect of site on FAA, suggestive of stronger FAA in park compared to the control site, akin to more positive mood. There was also a trend for the interaction between the site and scene, which suggests that even within the individual sites, there is variability depending on the specific scene. Adjusting for environmental covariate strengthened these effects, these interim findings are promising in supporting the study hypothesis and suggest that exposure to urban green spaces may be linked to mental health outcomes.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,17,2,,WOS:000516827400015,10.3390/ijerph17020394,,#143,Olszewska-Guizzo 2020,
The Effects of Urban Green Space on Depressive Symptoms of Mid-Aged and Elderly Urban Residents in China: Evidence from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study,"Zhou, R; Zheng, YJ; Yun, JY; Wang, HM","The aim of this study is to assess the impacts of urban green space on depressive symptoms among Chinese urban residents aged 45 and older. In total, 7397 urban respondents were included in this study. Each respondent participated in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study Wave 3 (2015). Environmental-level variables were retrieved from the National Bureau of Statistics database. Both unadjusted and adjusted methods were used in the multilevel regression analysis. Almost one-third of the sample population suffered from depressive symptoms (31.20%). The multilevel logistic regression model showed that green coverage ratio of city-built districts is negatively associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms among urban mid-aged (OR = 0.79, p < 0.05) and elderly (OR = 0.75, p < 0.05) residents, and the public recreational green space helps to reduce elderly people's depressive symptoms (OR = 0.77, p < 0.05). This study adds insights about the impact of green space and other environmental factors on depressive symptoms among mid-aged and elderly urban dwellers.

Participants of this study were 20 homogenous male students. Taman Botani Perdana, an urban park in Kuala Lumpur, and Jalan Bukit Bintang, a commercial district in the city centre were chosen as the study areas for this study. On the first day, the participants went to Taman Botani Perdana, and to Jalan Bukit Bintang on the second day. In both areas, the participants were instructed to walk along a given route for 20 minutes. Saliva samples were collected before and after walking in both areas along with blood pressure measurements. Self-reported physiological responses were measured before and after each walking session. Results indicated that salivary cortisol concentration significantly increased in the city, whereas no significant change was found in the urban park. Diastolic blood pressure significantly reduced after walking in the urban park. In terms of psychological responses, Total Mood Disturbance among the participants were significantly lower when they were in the urban park compared to the city. Meanwhile, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) showed that positive effect significantly increased after walking in the urban park, whereas the participants' positive effects significantly reduced after walking in the city. These results indicate that urban green space has positive benefits physiologically and psychologically compared to urban environment.",2018,,PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES,26,3,2101-2114,WOS:000456097200051,,,#151,Mokhtar 2018,
Assessing and Modelling the role of urban green spaces for human well-being in Lahore (Pakistan),"Jabbar, M; Yusoff, MM","Green structure is one of the major pillars of an urban structure, which accelerates life events by promoting physical activities, mental, and psychological relaxation, providing oxygen for breathing and purifying air pollutants. However, a rapid urban expansion is shrinking urban greenness within and surrounding the cities violating environmental guidelines. Therefore, being a rapidly growing and densely populated city, Lahore attracted the study to assess the role of urban green spaces for human well-being. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted and statistical regression analyses were performed to investigate the role of UGSs for human well-being. Finally, a structural equation model was developed, in which the role of UGSs for human well-being was found to be highly significant (beta = 0.904, R-2 = 0.817) at P < 0.00. Therefore, the study concluded that urban green spaces are a key to well-being in Lahore, which needs to protect admitting their significance to the residents.",,,GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL,,,,WOS:000815389600001,10.1080/10106049.2022.2087757,,#163,,
Urban street tree biodiversity and antidepressant prescriptions,"Marselle, MR; Bowler, DE; Watzema, J; Eichenberg, D; Kirsten, T; Bonn, A","Growing urbanisation is a threat to both mental health and biodiversity. Street trees are an important biodiversity component of urban greenspace, but little is known about their effects on mental health. Here, we analysed the association of street tree density and species richness with antidepressant prescribing for 9751 inhabitants of Leipzig, Germany. We examined spatial scale effects of street trees at different distances around participant's homes, using Euclidean buffers of 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m. Employing generalised additive models, we found a lower rate of antidepressant prescriptions for people living within 100 m of higher density of street trees-although this relationship was marginally significant (p=0.057) when confounding factors were considered. Density of street trees at further spatial distances, and species richness of street trees at any distance, were not associated with antidepressant prescriptions. However, for individuals with low socio-economic status, high density of street trees at 100 m around the home significantly reduced the probability of being prescribed antidepressants. The study suggests that unintentional daily contact to nature through street trees close to the home may reduce the risk of depression, especially for individuals in deprived groups. This has important implications for urban planning and nature-based health interventions in cities.",2020,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10,1,,WOS:000605618400016,10.1038/s41598-020-79924-5,,#170,Marselle 2020,
Addressing psychosocial issues caused by the COVID-19 lockdown: Can urban greeneries help?,"Rajoo, KS; Karam, DS; Abdu, A; Rosli, Z; Gerusu, GJ","The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected over 200 countries, forcing governments to impose lockdowns to contain the spread of the disease. Although effective in reducing infection rates, the lockdowns have also resulted in a severe negative impact on mental health throughout the world; Setting the foundation for mental illnesses to become the next ""silent"" pandemic. This study attempts to determine a selfcare method of ensuring mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those living under lockdown. We evaluated the potential of physical exercise (in a nature setting) and nature therapy in improving mental wellbeing, among young adults with either stress, anxiety or depression symptoms. The study involved thirty subjects, who were equally divided into a nature-exercise group and a nature therapy group. The participants were briefed on the activities that they were to perform on a daily basis, and both groups performed their assigned activities concurrently for one week (27th April 2020 to 3rd May 2020) at urban greeneries accessible to them (rooftop parks, neighbourhood parks, home gardens). We used the depression, anxiety and stress scale - 21 items (DASS-21) to evaluate the mental health status of participants, once before beginning the study (baseline readings) and once at the end of the study (after a week of nature-exercise/nature therapy). There was a statistically significant reduction in stress, anxiety and depression symptoms for both the nature-exercise and nature therapy groups. However, when evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and nature therapy in treating stress, anxiety and depression symptoms on a case-by-case basis, it was discovered that nature therapy was more effective in treating mental health issues. Hence, nature therapy has the potential to be a form of preventive medicine, namely in preserving mental health during the COVID-19 crisis.",2021,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,65,,,WOS:000701984700002,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127340,,#171,Rajoo 2021,

Nature relatedness and green space in the neighbourhood of the house were associated with higher exposure to green space, which was in turn negatively associated with stress and depression. Garden quality, indicated by biodiversity values and size, and nature relatedness were associated with being active in the garden, which was in turn associated with lower values of depression, but not stress.Nature relatedness seems to play a key role in the pathway linking gardens to improved health.

The mental health benefits of visiting canals and rivers: An ecological momentary assessment study,"Bergou, N; Hammoud, R; Smythe, M; Gibbons, J; Davidson, N; Tognin, S; Reeves, G; Shepherd, J; Mechelli, A","Existing evidence shows positive effects of being in nature on wellbeing, but we know little about the mental health benefits of spending time near canals and rivers specifically. This study investigates the association between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing. We addressed the following questions: Are visits to canals and rivers associated with higher levels of mental wellbeing? Does this association depend on age and gender? Does this association vary between people with and without a diagnosis on mental illness? We used Urban Mind, a flexible smartphone application for examining the impact of different aspects of the built and social environment on mental wellbeing, a strong predictor of mental health. Participants were invited to complete an ecological momentary assessment three times a day for fourteen days. Each assessment included questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. A total of 7,975 assessments were completed by 299 participants including 87 with a diagnosis of mental illness. Multilevel regression models were used to analyse the data. We found positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing (p < .05) when compared to being anywhere else and when compared to being in green spaces. Increases in mental wellbeing were still evident after the visit had taken place. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education, and were consistent in people with and without a diagnosis of mental illness. Spending time near canals and rivers is associated with better mental wellbeing. These findings have potential implications for mental health as well as urban planning and policy. Visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in preventing mental health difficulties and complementing more traditional interventions.",2022,,PLOS ONE,17,8,,WOS:000892368200012,10.1371/journal.pone.0271306,,#187,Bergou 2022,
Beyond Proximity: The Importance of Green Space Useability to Self-Reported Health,"Carter, M; Horwitz, P","Access to parks and green spaces within residential neighbourhoods has been shown to be an important pathway to generating better physical and mental health for individuals and communities.

Casual evaluation of the effects of a large-scale greenway intervention on physical and mental health: A natural experimental study in China,"Xie, B; Lu, Y; Zheng, YL","Many cross-sectional studies have supported the health benefits of urban greenways. However, the causal relationship between urban greenway intervention and residents' physical and mental health remains unclear. Furthermore, the potential dose-response effect by distance to a greenway intervention remains unknown. This study explored the impact of a large-scale urban greenway intervention (construction of a 102-km-long East Lake Greenway in Wuhan, China) on the health outcomes of residents by using a natural experimental research design. We collected data before and after the intervention (in 2016 and 2019, respectively) from 1,020 participants living within a 5-km street-network distance from the entrances of this greenway. The average age of the par-ticipants was approximately 50, and most of them were married. More than half of the participants were female, currently employed, and had received a college education or above. Mixed-effects difference-in-difference (DID) models were used while controlling for individual and neighbourhood covariates. The results showed that the East Lake Greenway had a positive effect on the self-reported mental health of residents who lived within 2 km, and these benefits decreased with distance. The physical health benefit was insignificant. To increase the health benefits of urban greenways, more effort should be made to improve the accessibility of greenways and the surrounding environment.

Assessment of mediators in the associations between urban green spaces and self-reported health,"Zhang, LQ; Tan, PY; Gan, DRY; Samsudin, R","Although urban green spaces (UGS) are widely known to confer health benefits, evidence of the specific mechanisms that mediate the pathways from UGS provision and exposure to health outcomes remains limited. In particular, the question of whether exposure to UGS is an independent variable or a mediator in UGS-health linkages remains inadequately addressed. Using a nationally representative household survey in Singapore, this study investigated two models of the pathways linking UGS provision, UGS exposure, three mediators (emotional regulation, social interaction, and physical activities conducted in UGS) and self-reported mental and general health. The first model regarded both UGS provision and exposure as the independent variables and the second treated UGS exposure as the intermediate variable. Path analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to measure the theorised pathways. Good model fit for both models were found. Emotional regulation mediated 52% of the associations of perceived UGS provision and UGS exposure with mental health. Social interaction mediated 100% of the association of UGS with general health. However, green physical activities did not show any significant mediating effect. UGS exposure mediated only 11.5% of the pathways linking perceived UGS provision to other three mediators. Direct use of UGS is not a requisite for obtaining health benefits from UGS, as UGS provision independent of direct use is a significant variable. The use of UGS, however, provides undeniable benefits as UGS exposure was related to both health outcomes with full mediating effects. This study contributes to the understanding of underlying mechanisms in UGS-health associations.",2022,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,226,,,WOS:000826304100003,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104503,,#199,Zhang 2022,
Home gardens can be more important than other urban green infrastructure for mental well-being during COVID-19 pandemics,"Marques, P; Silva, AS; Quaresma, Y; Manna, LR; Neto, ND; Mazzoni, R","The current COVID-19 pandemics is a major threat to human populations. The disease has rapidly spread, causing mass hospitalization and the loss of millions of people mainly in urban areas which are hubs for contagion. At the same time, the social distancing practices required for containing the outbreak have caused an eruption of mental illnesses that include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The severity of such mental distress is modulated by the context of media coverage and the information and guidelines from local health authorities. Different urban green infrastructures, such as gardens, parks, and green views can be important for mitigating mental distress during the pandemics. However, it is unclear whether some urban green infrastructures are more efficient than others in reducing mental distress or whether their effectiveness changes with the context. Here we assess the relative importance of different urban green infrastructures on the mental distress of residents of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We show that although urban parks and green views are important, home gardens are the most efficient in mitigating mental distress. This is likely related to the practice of selfisolation seen for the residents of Rio de Janeiro. Information on the efficiency of different urban green infrastructures in mitigating mental distress can be important to help guide programs to inform the public about the best practices for maintaining mental health during the current outbreak. This can also help planning cities that are more resilient to future pandemics.",2021,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,64,,,WOS:000692555400009,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127268,,#201,Marques 2021,

However, most of the evidence has focused on green spaces and little evidence is available on health benefits of blue spaces and about possible mediators and modifiers of such impacts. We investigated the association between natural outdoor environments (separately for green and blue spaces) and health (general and mental) and its possible mediators and modifiers.Methods: Cross-sectional data from adults interviewed in Catalonia (Spain) between 2010 and 2012 as part of the Catalonia Health Survey were used. The collected data included sociodemographic characteristics, self-perceived general health, mental health, physical activity and social support. Indicators of surrounding greenness and access to natural outdoor environments within 300 m of the residence and degree of urbanization were derived for residential addresses. Associations were estimated using logistic regression and negative binominal models.Results: Green spaces were associated with better self-perceived general health and better mental health, independent of degree of urbanization. The associations were more consistent for surrounding greenness than for access to green spaces. The results were consistent for different buffers, and when stratifying for socioeconomic status. Slightly stronger associations were found for women and residents of non-densely populated areas. No association was found between green spaces and social contacts and physical activity. The results for blue spaces were not conclusive.Conclusion: Green spaces are associated with better general and mental health across strata of urbanization, socioeconomic status, and genders. Mechanisms other than physical activity or social support may explain these associations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus of this paper is the nature of access to green space (i.e., its quantity or use) necessary before any health benefit is found. It draws on a cross-sectional survey of 406 adults in four communities of high urban deprivation in Scotland, United Kingdom. Self-reported measures of stress and general health were primary outcomes; physical activity and social wellbeing were also measured. A comprehensive, objective measure of green space quantity around each participant's home was also used, alongside self-report measures of use of local green space. Correlated Component Regression identified the optimal predictors for primary outcome variables in the different communities surveyed. Social isolation and place belonging were the strongest predictors of stress in three out of four communities sampled, and of poor general health in the fourth, least healthy, community. The amount of green space in the neighbourhood, and in particular access to a garden or allotment, were significant predictors of stress. Physical activity, frequency of visits to green space in winter months, and views from the home were predictors of general health.

An additional 3.3% of 32 991experienced psychological distress incidence, 7.5% of 39 277 experienced depression or anxiety incidence, and 7.3% of 4 0 741experienced fair to poor self-rated health incidence by follow-up (mean [SD] of 6.2 [1.62] years later). Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, sex, income, economic status, couple status, and educational level indicated that exposures of 30% or more total green space (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.69) and tree canopy specifically (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88) were associated with lower incidence of psychological distress. Exposure to tree canopy of 30% or more, compared with 0% to 9%, was also associated with lower incidence of fair to poor general health (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.80). Exposure to grass of 30% or more, compared with 0% to 4%, was associated with higher odds of incident fair to poor general health (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12-1.91) and prevalent psychological distress (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.25-2.28). Exposure to low-lying vegetation was not consistently associated with any outcome. No green space indicator was associated with prevalent or incident depression or anxiety.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Protection and restoration of urban tree canopy specifically, rather than any urban greening, may be a good option for promotion of community mental health.",2019,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,2,7,,WOS:000477895900081,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.8209,,#234,Astell-Burt 2019,
"The nexus between urban green space, housing type, and mental health","Feng, XQ; Toms, R; Astell-Burt, T","Introduction Momentum for urban densification is increasing opportunities for apartment-living, but can result in reduced green space availability that negatively influences mental health. However, in contexts where apartment-living is atypical and commonly viewed as secondary to house-ownership, it may be a stressful antecedent condition (or marker of selective processes aligned with psychological distress) wherein occupants could benefit disproportionately from green space. Method Data were extracted from the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study baseline (2006-2009, n = 267,153). The focus was on subsets of 13,196 people living in apartments and 66,453 people living in households within the cities of Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. Multilevel models adjusted for confounders tested associations between psychological distress (Kessler 10 scale) with percentage total green space, tree canopy and open grass within 1.6 km road network buffers. Results Psychological distress was higher in occupants of apartments (11.3%) compared with houses (7.9%). More green space was associated with less psychological distress for house-dwellers (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.98), but there was no association for apartment-dwellers. More tree canopy was associated with lower psychological distress for house-dwellers (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85-0.92) and apartment-dwellers (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.96). Open grass was associated with more psychological distress among house-dwellers (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00-1.13) and also for apartment-dwellers (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.07-1.35). Conclusions Overall, investments in tree canopy may benefit the mental health of house and apartment residents relatively equally. Urban tree canopy in densely populated areas where apartments are common needs to be protected. Further work is needed to understand factors constraining the prevention potential of open grass, to unlock its benefits for mental health.",2022,,SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,57,9,1917-1923,WOS:000780805500003,10.1007/s00127-022-02266-2,,#236,Feng 2022,
Physiological and Psychological Effects of a Walk in Urban Parks in Fall,"Song, CR; Ikei, H; Igarashi, M; Takagaki, M; Miyazaki, Y","In recent times, attention has been focused on the role of urban green spaces in promoting human health and well-being. However, there is a lack of evidence-based research on the physiological effects of walking in urban green areas. This study aimed to clarify the physiological and psychological effects of walking in urban parks during fall. Twenty-three males (mean age 22.3 +/- 1.2 years) were instructed to walk predetermined 15-min courses in an urban park and in a nearby city area (control). Heart rate and heart rate variability were measured to assess physiological responses, and the semantic differential method, Profile of Mood States, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used to measure psychological responses. We observed that walking in an urban park resulted in a significantly lower heart rate, higher parasympathetic nerve activity, and lower sympathetic nerve activity than walking through the city area. In subjective evaluations, participants were more comfortable, natural, relaxed, and vigorous after a walk in the urban park. Furthermore, they exhibited significantly lower levels of negative emotions and anxiety.

Effects of Environmental Features in Small Public Urban Green Spaces on Older Adults' Mental Restoration: Evidence from Tokyo,"Lu, S; Oh, W; Ooka, R; Wang, LJ","Exposure to small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) has been demonstrated to have mental benefits for older adults. However, studies on identifying the objective environmental features of SPUGS and their effects on mental restoration for older adults remain limited. This study employed a multilevel regression model to investigate the restorative and vitalizing effects of the environmental features of 11 SPUGS in Tokyo. Onsite measurements were conducted in Kita-Ku, and 202 older adults were surveyed. The results showed that: (1) The fitting curve of the green view index and Restoration Outcome Scale (ROS) score showed an inverted U shape-both green view index and boundary enclosure had a strong impact on the mental restoration of older adults; (2) The colorfulness index showed the strongest relationship with the vitalizing effect. (3) The sky view factor and number of seats only influenced the ROS score, while the results of revitalization suggest that large areas of water should be avoided. (4) Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was also confirmed to have negative effects on the mental restoration of older adults in autumn.

Reloading Pupils' Batteries: Impact of Green Spaces on Cognition and Wellbeing,"Wallner, P; Kundi, M; Arnberger, A; Eder, R; Allex, B; Weitensfelder, L; Hutter, HP","Cognitive functioning and academic performance of pupils depend on regular breaks from classroom work. However, it is unclear which settings during such breaks provide the best environment to restore cognitive performance and promote wellbeing of adolescent pupils. Therefore, we investigated the effects of staying in different urban green spaces during breaks. Sixty-four pupils (16-18 years old) participated in a cross-over experiment. They were placed into one of three settings (small park, larger park, forest) for one hour during a lunch break. Wellbeing was assessed four times (Nitsch scale), and a cognitive test (d2-R Test of Attention) was applied in the classrooms before and after the break. Wellbeing was almost always highest after the stay in the green spaces. However, a sustained effect was only found for the forest. Concentration performance values of the d2-R test were significantly higher after the pupils' stay in green spaces for all sites. The highest increase of performance was found for the larger park type. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that study breaks in green spaces improved wellbeing and cognitive performance of adolescents. It also found that larger green spaces, either parks or forests, have stronger positive impacts on wellbeing and cognitive performance than small parks.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,15,6,,WOS:000436496900156,10.3390/ijerph15061205,,#253,Wallner 2018,
Physiological and psychological responses of young males during spring-time walks in urban parks,"Song, C; Ikei, H; Igarashi, M; Miwa, M; Takagaki, M; Miyazaki, Y","Background: It is widely believed that contact with the natural environment can improve physical and mental health. Urban green spaces may provide city residents with these benefits; however, there is a lack of empirical field research on the health benefits of urban parks.Methods: This field experiment was performed in May. Seventeen males aged 21.2 +/- 1.7 years (mean +/- standard deviation) were instructed to walk predetermined 15-minute courses in an urban park and a nearby city area (control). Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured to assess physiological responses. The semantic differential (SD) method, Profile of Mood States (POMS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to measure psychological responses.Results: Heart rate was significantly lower while walking in the urban park than while walking in the city street. Furthermore, the urban park walk led to higher parasympathetic nervous activity and lower sympathetic nervous activity compared with the walk through the city street. Subjective evaluations were generally in accordance with physiological reactions, and significantly higher scores were observed for the 'comfortable', 'natural', and 'relaxed' parameters following the urban park walk. After the urban park walk, the score for the 'vigor' subscale of the POMS was significantly higher, whereas that for negative feelings such as 'tension-anxiety' and 'fatigue' was significantly lower. The score for the anxiety dimension of the STAI was also significantly lower after the urban park walk.Conclusions: Physiological and psychological results from this field experiment provide evidence for the physiological and psychological benefits of urban green spaces.

Childhood exposure to green space - A novel risk-decreasing mechanism for schizophrenia?,"Kristine, E; Bocker, PC; Lars, A; Constantinos, T; Bo, MP; Jens-Christian, S","Schizophrenia risk has been linked to urbanization, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Green space is hypothesized to positively influence mental health and might mediate risk of schizophrenia by mitigating noise and particle pollution exposure, stress relief, or other unknown mechanisms. The objectives for this study were to determine if green space are associated with schizophrenia risk, and if different measures of green space associate differently with risk. We used satellite data from the Landsat program to quantify green space in a new data set for Denmark at 30 x 30 m resolution for the years 1985-2013. The effect of green space at different ages and within different distances from each person's place of residence on schizophrenia risk was estimated using Cox regression on a very large longitudinal population-based sample of the Danish population (943,027 persons). Living at the lowest amount of green space was associated with a 1.52-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia compared to persons living at the highest level of green space. This association remained after adjusting for known risk factors for schizophrenia: urbanization, age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The strongest protective association was observed during the earliest childhood years and closest to place of residence. This is the first nationwide population-based study to demonstrate a protective association between green space during childhood and schizophrenia risk; suggesting limited green space as a novel environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. This study supports findings from other studies highlighting positive effects of exposure to natural environments for human health. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Do Emotional Perceptions of Visible Greeneries Rely on the Largeness of Green Space? A Verification in Nanchang, China","Huang, SY; Zhu, JJ; Zhai, KB; Wang, Y; Wei, HX; Xu, ZH; Gu, XR","Experiencing nature can induce the perception of happiness because of mental stress alleviation and well-being restoration. The largeness of green space may not always mean the frequency of experiencing greenery. It is arguing about the probability of positive sentiments in response to an experience of interacting with green nature. In this study, 38 green spaces were investigated in Nanchang City, China, where the green space area was evaluated by the largeness of the landscape metrics of the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Green View Index (GVI) data were further obtained using Open Street Maps (OSM). The semantic segmentation method was used by machine learning to analyze a total of 1549 panoramic photos taken in field surveys to assess the Panoramic Green View Index (PGVI) proportion. The photos of 2400 people's facial expressions were obtained from social networks at their check-in visits in green spaces and rated for happy and sad scores using FireFACE software. Split-plot analysis of variance suggested that different categories of NDVI largeness had a significant positive effect on posted positive sentiments. Multivariate linear regression indicated that PGVI was estimated to have a significant contribution to facial expression. Increasing the amount of PGVI promoted happy and PRI scores, while at the same time, neutral sentiments decreased with increasing PGVI. Overall, increasing the PGVI in green spaces, especially in parks with smaller green spaces, can be effective in promoting positive emotions in the visitor experience.",2022,,FORESTS,13,8,,WOS:000846083100001,10.3390/f13081192,,#276,Huang 2022,

This study examines associations of green space exposures with subjective health and depressed affect of middle-aged and older adults in four European cohorts. Methods Data came from four Western-European and Central-European ageing cohorts harmonised as part of the Mindmap project, comprising 16 189 adults with an average age of 50-71 years. Green space exposure was based on the distance to the nearest green space and the amount of green space within 800 m buffers around residential addresses. Cohort-specific and one-step individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses were used to examine associations of green space exposures with subjective health and depressed affect. Results The amount of green spaces within 800 m buffers was lowest for Residential Environment and CORonary heart Disease (Paris, 15.0 hectares) and highest for Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, 35.9 hectares). IPD analyses indicated no evidence of an association between the distance to the nearest green space and depressed affect (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00) or good self-rated health (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02). Likewise, the amount of green space within 800 m buffers did not predict depressed affect (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00) or good self-rated health (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02).

We used longitudinal data in a cohort of 3,568 adolescents aged 9 to 15 years at 31 schools across London, UK, to examine the associations between natural-environment types and adolescents' cognitive development, mental health and overall well-being. We characterized natural-environment types in three tiers, where natural space was distinguished into green and blue space, and green space was further distinguished into woodland and grassland. We showed that, after adjusting for other confounding variables, higher daily exposure to woodland, but not grassland, was associated with higher scores for cognitive development and a lower risk of emotional and behavioural problems for adolescents. A similar but smaller effect was seen for green space, but not blue space, with higher scores for cognitive development.

Not All Green Space Is Created Equal: Biodiversity Predicts Psychological Restorative Benefits From Urban Green Space,"Wood, E; Harsant, A; Dallimer, M; de Chavez, AC; McEachan, RRC; Hassall, C","Contemporary epidemiological methods testing the associations between green space and psychological well-being treat all vegetation cover as equal. However, there is very good reason to expect that variations in ecological ""quality"" (number of species, integrity of ecological processes) may influence the link between access to green space and benefits to human health and well-being. We test the relationship between green space quality and restorative benefit in an inner city urban population in Bradford, United Kingdom. We selected 12 urban parks for study where we carried out botanical and faunal surveys to quantify biodiversity and assessed the site facilities of the green space (cleanliness, provision of amenities). We also conducted 128 surveys with park users to quantify psychological restoration based on four self-reported measure of general restoration, attention-grabbing distractions, being away from everyday life, and site preference. We present three key results. First, there is a positive association between site facilities and biodiversity. Second, restorative benefit is predicted by biodiversity, which explained 43% of the variance in restorative benefit across the parks, with minimal input from other variables. Third, the benefits accrued through access to green space were unrelated to age, gender, and ethnic background.

This study aimed to understand whether exposure to green space buffered against stress and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic while taking into account significant stressors of the pandemic. MethodsWe leveraged a cross-sectional survey on green space exposure and mental health among residents of Denver, CO that ran from November 2019 through January 2021. We measured objective green space as the average NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from aerial imagery within 300m and 500m of the participant's residence. Perceived green space was measured through Likert scores on five questions about vegetation near the home that captured perceived abundance, visibility, access, usage, and quality of green space. We used generalized linear models to assess the relationship between each green space exposure variable and perceived stress (PSS-4), depression (CES-D-10), or anxiety (MMPI-2) adjusted for sociodemographic and COVID-19 impact variables. ResultsWe found significantly higher depression scores for all covid periods compared to the ""before covid"" period, and significantly higher anxiety scores during the ""fall wave"" compared to earlier periods. Adjusted for sociodemographic and pandemic stressors, we found that spending a lot of time in green space (usage) was significantly associated with lower anxiety and depression. We also observed significantly lower depression scores associated with NDVI in both buffers (objective abundance) and significantly lower anxiety scores with perceived abundance of green space. There was some evidence of lower anxiety scores for people reporting having high quality green spaces near the home (quality).

Residential green and blue space associated with better mental health: a pilot follow-up study in university students,"Dzhambov, AM","Previous research has suggested that natural urban environment (green space and blue space) benefit mental health, but only a few longitudinal studies have explored the underlying mechanisms. In this pilot study we aimed to examine mechanisms/variables mediating associations between residential green/blue space and symptoms of anxiety/depression in 109 Bulgarian students from Plovdiv university. The students were followed from the beginning to the end of the school year (October 2017 to May 2018). Residential green space was defined as the mean of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in circular buffers of 100, 300, and 500 m around their residences. Blue space was assessed based on its presence in the same buffers. Levels of anxiety/depression were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The investigated mediator variables included residential noise (L-Aeq) and air pollution (NO2), environmental annoyance, perceived restorative quality of the neighbourhood, neighbourhood social cohesion, physical activity, and sleep disturbance. Cross-sectional data (obtained at baseline) showed that higher NDVI correlated with better mental health only indirectly through higher physical activity and restorative quality. Longitudinal (follow-up) data showed improved mental health but no significant effect of mediator variables. Similarly, blue space correlated with better mental health in all models, but physical activity and restorative quality were significant mediator variables only in the cross-sectional analysis. Our findings support that green space and blue space are psychologically restorative features in urban environment.

The Wellbeing Benefits Associated with Perceived and Measured Biodiversity in Australian Urban Green Spaces,"Schebella, MF; Weber, D; Schultz, L; Weinstein, P","There are few studies examining the wellbeing benefits from exposure to natural environments differing in ecological attributes, such as biodiversity, and they have not had consistent results. This study progresses our understanding of the nuanced relationship between nature and wellbeing by analyzing the self-reported benefits derived from urban green spaces varying in a range of objectively measured biodiversity attributes such as bird species richness, habitat diversity, and structural heterogeneity. Respondents' (n = 840) perceptions of biodiversity and naturalness were also examined. We identified the biodiversity attributes most strongly associated with particular benefits, as well as the types of parks where those benefits were significantly more likely to occur. Findings suggest that perceived, rather than objective measures of biodiversity are better predictors of subjective wellbeing benefits. Of the assessed biodiversity attributes, vegetation cover consistently correlated most strongly with psychological benefits. Stress reduction and mood improvement were greatest in nature parks and lowest in pocket parks. Increases in each biodiversity attribute significantly affected psychological wellbeing at different thresholds, suggesting the relationship between biodiversity and wellbeing is not linear. Thresholds of sensitivity for park attributes are discussed, with vegetation cover, naturalness, structural heterogeneity, and park type emerging as the most useful differentiators for studying human responses to nature.

The Relationship between Natural Park Usage and Happiness Does Not Hold in a Tropical City-State,"Saw, LE; Lim, FKS; Carrasco, LR","Previous studies have shown that contact with urban green spaces can produce positive effects on people's stress, health and well-being levels. However, much of this research has been conducted in the temperate regions of Europe or North America. Additionally, most studies have only compared the effects of urban and natural areas on health and wellbeing, but not made a finer distinction between different types of urban green spaces. We tested the relationship between well-being and the access or use of different types of green spaces among young adults in Singapore, a tropical city-state. The results showed that extraversion and emotional stability increased subjective well-being, positive affect and life satisfaction and decreased stress and negative affect. In addition, we found that level of physical activity increased positive affect and health problems increased negative affect. Neither access to green spaces nor the use of green spaces in Singapore significantly affected the well-being metrics considered, contradicting findings in the temperate regions of the world. We hypothesize that the differences in temperature and humidity and the higher greenery and biodiversity levels outside parks in Singapore could explain this phenomenon. Our results thus question the universality of the relationship between well-being and park usage and highlight the need for more research into the multifaceted effects of green spaces on well-being in the tropics.",2015,,PLOS ONE,10,7,,WOS:000358836800065,10.1371/journal.pone.0133781,,#329,Saw 2015,
"Public park attributes, park visits, and associated health status","Grilli, G; Mohan, G; Curtis, J","The salutary potential of urban greenspace for users' physical and mental health has been investigated in a large number of empirical studies. Additionally, the pathways by which users derive health benefits from greenspace have been theorised; which include opportunities for psychological restorative experiences, physical activity and social interaction. In this paper, the relationship between health, current use of public greenspace and preferences for attributes within green settings are examined. First, we consider how several health indicators are associated with visits to greenspace to understand the benefits of current greenspace availability within cities. To address potential sorting and sample selection into greenspace use, a structural regression model is estimated within a two-step procedure. We also employ a choice experiment methodology to assess people's preferences for attributes which can be provided in greenspaces. The utility afforded by each attribute is evaluated separately, facilitating an assessment of the potential increase in visitation associated with varying levels of greenspace attributes. Data originated from a survey of Irish citizens. Results indicate that higher levels of visitation to greenspaces are related to better health. Moreover, the attribute preference exploration suggests that number of visits are likely to increase with the provision of specific greenspace attributes, particularly visitor facilities.",2020,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,199,,,WOS:000528059400001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103814,,#330,Grilli 2020,
The urban brain: analysing outdoor physical activity with mobile EEG,"Aspinall, P; Mavros, P; Coyne, R; Roe, J","Background Researchers in environmental psychology, health studies and urban design are interested in the relationship between the environment, behaviour settings and emotions. In particular, happiness, or the presence of positive emotional mindsets, broadens an individual's thought-action repertoire with positive benefits to physical and intellectual activities, and to social and psychological resources. This occurs through play, exploration or similar activities. In addition, a body of restorative literature focuses on the potential benefits to emotional recovery from stress offered by green space and 'soft fascination'. However, access to the cortical correlates of emotional states of a person actively engaged within an environment has not been possible until recently. This study investigates the use of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) as a method to record and analyse the emotional experience of a group of walkers in three types of urban environment including a green space setting.Methods Using Emotiv EPOC, a low-cost mobile EEG recorder, participants took part in a 25 min walk through three different areas of Edinburgh. The areas (of approximately equal length) were labelled zone 1 (urban shopping street), zone 2 (path through green space) and zone 3 (street in a busy commercial district). The equipment provided continuous recordings from five channels, labelled excitement (short-term), frustration, engagement, long-term excitement (or arousal) and meditation.Results A new form of high-dimensional correlated component logistic regression analysis showed evidence of lower frustration, engagement and arousal, and higher meditation when moving into the green space zone; and higher engagement when moving out of it.Conclusions Systematic differences in EEG recordings were found between three urban areas in line with restoration theory. This has implications for promoting urban green space as a mood-enhancing environment for walking or for other forms of physical or reflective activity.",2015,,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE,49,4,272-U91,WOS:000348990700012,10.1136/bjsports-2012-091877,,#335,Aspinall 2015,
"Exercise-, nature- and socially interactive-based initiatives improve mood and self-esteem in the clinical population","Barton, J; Griffin, M; Pretty, J","Aims: This study evaluated two existing group-based health promotion initiatives (a social club and a swimming group) and compared these to a new green exercise programme (weekly countryside and urban park walks).Methods: Participants represented a clinical population (N = 53) and were all experiencing a range of mental health problems. They only attended one of the three programmes and sessions were held once a week for six weeks in all initiatives. Composite questionnaires incorporating two standardized measures to analyse changes in self-esteem and mood were completed before and after all sessions.Results: A significant main effect for self-esteem and mood pre and post activity (p < 0.001) was reported after participating in a single session. The change in self-esteem was significantly greater in the green exercise group compared with the social activities club (p < 0.001). Dose responses showed that both self-esteem and mood levels improved over the six-week period and improvements were related to attendance in the green exercise group.Conclusions: Green exercise as a health-promoting initiative for people experiencing mental ill health is equally as effective as existing programmes. Combining exercise, nature and social components in future initiatives may play a key role in managing and supporting recovery from mental ill health, suggesting a potential 'green' approach to mental healthcare and promotion.",2012,,PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH,132,2,89-96,WOS:000301890600017,10.1177/1757913910393862,,#343,Barton 2012,
Neighbourhood blue space and mental health: A nationwide ecological study of antidepressant medication prescribed to older adults,"McDougall, CW; Hanley, N; Quilliam, RS; Bartie, PJ; Robertson, T; Griffiths, M; Oliver, DM","As global populations age rapidly, older adult mental health is becoming an increasingly important public health issue. The consequences of poor mental health in later life are severe and include reduced physical and cognitive functioning and greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Neighbourhood characteristics, such as the presence of aquatic environments - or 'blue spaces' - can positively impact mental health. However, evidence supporting the potential of neighbourhood blue space to promote mental health among older adults remains tentative. This study used negative binomial regression modelling to quantify the association between multiple metrics of neighbourhood blue space availability and antidepressant medication prevalence among older adults in Scotland. The study combined nationwide antidepressant prescription data for over two million older adults and geospatial data of blue space availability for over six thousand neighbourhoods and adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic covariates. The availability of both freshwater and coastal blue space was associated with lower antidepressant medication prevalence among older adults in Scotland. Specifically, high neighbourhood freshwater coverage ( 3%) (p < 0.001) and residing in close proximity (<1 km) to the coast (p < 0.001) and large freshwater lakes (p < 0.05) was associated with lower antidepressant medication prevalence. Our findings also suggest that neighbourhood blue space availability may have a greater impact on antidepressant medication prevalence among older adults than neighbourhood green space availability. Freshwater and coastal blue space, therefore, merit greater consideration in public health and urban planning policy and in the design of environments that aim to promote mental health and healthy aging.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,214,,,WOS:000681111700001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104132,,#361,McDougall 2021,
Nature experience reduces rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation,"Bratman, GN; Hamilton, JP; Hahn, KS; Daily, GC; Gross, JJ","Urbanization has many benefits, but it also is associated with increased levels of mental illness, including depression. It has been suggested that decreased nature experience may help to explain the link between urbanization and mental illness. This suggestion is supported by a growing body of correlational and experimental evidence, which raises a further question: what mechanism(s) link decreased nature experience to the development of mental illness? One such mechanism might be the impact of nature exposure on rumination, a maladaptive pattern of self-referential thought that is associated with heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses. We show in healthy participants that a brief nature experience, a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity. In other studies, the sgPFC has been associated with a self-focused behavioral withdrawal linked to rumination in both depressed and healthy individuals. This study reveals a pathway by which nature experience may improve mental well-being and suggests that accessible natural areas within urban contexts may be a critical resource for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.",2015,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,112,28,8567-8572,WOS:000357878700034,10.1073/pnas.1510459112,,#362,Bratman 2015,
"Understanding the relationship between neighbourhood green space and mental wellbeing: A case study of Beijing, China","Qin, B; Zhu, W; Wang, JJ; Peng, YY","The past few decades have seen increasing academic interest in the association between green space and mental health. However, the existing studies have largely been undertaken in developed countries, while less attention has been paid to rapidly urbanizing countries. Based on a 2015 survey of 701 residents in 16 typical neighbourhoods of Beijing, this study aims to partially fill this gap by investigating the complex relationship between neighbourhood green space and residents' mental health in urban China. We developed multilevel regression models to test the associations among green space, social cohesion, physical activity, and mental health. The findings reveal the positive association between green space and mental health in a high-density and compact urban environment and suggest that physical activity and social cohesion might play a mediating role in the association.

Effectiveness of urban green space on undergraduates' stress relief in tropical city: A field experiment in Kuala Lumpur,"Aziz, NAA; Shian, LY; Mokhtar, MDM; Raman, TL; Saikim, FH; Chen, W; Nordin, NM","This research examined the psychological (perceived restoratives, emotion, stress, and mood) and physiological (blood pressure readings) effects of short-range visits to urban environments. Ninety participants visited two urban areas; Bukit Jalil Urban Park (a green space) and Bukit Jalil Urban Street (an urban a built-up city centre as a controlled environment) located in a tropical city Kuala Lumpur. Participants took a 20-minute leisure walk along the given routes in both the study areas. The findings indicate that the urban park has had an overall rehabilitative impact in contrast to the built-up environment. Overall, the positive emotion has increased, and mood disturbance has decreased in the metropolitan green area after the field experiment. The findings demonstrate that even short-term visits to urban parks decidedly influence stress reduction compared to an urban built-up city centre. However, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased insignificantly after walking in the park.

It is unclear whether this association is mediated by genetic liability or whether the 2 risk factors work additively. Here, we investigate possible gene-environment associations with the hazard ratio (HR) of schizophrenia by combining (1) an estimate of childhood exposure to residential-level green space based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat satellite images, with (2) genetic liability estimates based on polygenic risk scores for 19 746 genotyped individuals from the Danish iPSYCH sample. We used information from the Danish registers of health, residential address, and socioeconomic status to adjust HR estimates for established confounders, ie, parents' socioeconomic status, and family history of mental illness. The adjusted HRs show that growing up surrounded by the highest compared to the lowest decile of NDVI was associated with a 0.52-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.66) lower schizophrenia risk, and children with the highest polygenic risk score had a 1.24-fold (95% CI: 1.18 to 1.30) higher schizophrenia risk. We found that NDVI explained 1.45% (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.90) of the variance on the liability scale, while polygenic risk score for schizophrenia explained 1.01% (95% CI: 0.77 to 1.46). Together they explained 2.40% (95% CI: 1.99 to 3.07) with no indication of a gene-environment interaction (P = .29).

Exposure to Neighborhood Green Space and Mental Health: Evidence from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin,"Beyer, KMM; Kaltenbach, A; Szabo, A; Bogar, S; Nieto, FJ; Malecki, KM","Green space is now widely viewed as a health-promoting characteristic of residential environments, and has been linked to mental health benefits such as recovery from mental fatigue and reduced stress, particularly through experimental work in environmental psychology. Few population level studies have examined the relationships between green space and mental health. Further, few studies have considered the role of green space in non-urban settings. This study contributes a population-level perspective from the United States to examine the relationship between environmental green space and mental health outcomes in a study area that includes a spectrum of urban to rural environments. Multivariate survey regression analyses examine the association between green space and mental health using the unique, population-based Survey of the Health of Wisconsin database. Analyses were adjusted for length of residence in the neighborhood to reduce the impact of neighborhood selection bias.

Is urban green space associated with lower mental healthcare expenditure?,"Astell-Burt, T; Navakatikyan, M; Eckermann, S; Hackett, M; Feng, XQ","Introduction: While the evidence of mental health benefits from investing in green space accumulates, claims of reduced healthcare expenditure are rarely supported by evidence from analyses of actual healthcare data. Additionally, the question of 'who pays?' has been ignored. We addressed these gaps using person-level data in three Australian cities.Methods: 55,339 participants with a mean follow-up time of 4.97 years in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (wave 2, collected 2012-2015) were linked to fee-for-service records of antidepressant prescriptions and talking therapy subsidised by the Australian Government (including data on per unit fee, state subsidy, and individual co-payment). Total green space, tree canopy and open grass within 1.6 km road network distances were linked to each participant. Multilevel logistic, negative binomial, and generalised linear models with gamma distribution adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic confounders were used to assess association between each green space variable and prescribing/referral and costs of antidepressants and talking therapy.Results: Prescription of at least one course of antidepressants occurred for 20.01% (n = 11,071). Referral for at least one session of talking therapy occurred in 8.95% (n = 4954). 13,482 participants (24.4%) had either a prescription or a referral. A 10% increase in green space was associated with higher levels of antidepressant prescribing (e.g. incident rate ratio (IRR) = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.04-1.08). Tree canopy was not associated with antidepressant prescribing or referrals for talking therapy. Open grass was associated with higher odds (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.13-1.20) and counts (IRR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02-1.08) of antidepressant prescriptions. Open grass was also associated with lower odds (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.82-0.92) and counts (IRR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.90-0.96) of talking therapy referrals.

Exposure to nature and mental health outcomes during COVID-19 lockdown. A comparison between Portugal and Spain,"Ribeiro, AI; Triguero-Mas, M; Santos, CJ; Gomez-Nieto, A; Cole, H; Anguelovski, I; Silva, FM; Baro, F","Background: To control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, countries around the world implemented lockdowns with varying intensities. Lockdowns, however, have been associated with a deterioration of mental health, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, anger and anxiety. Exposure to nature might reduce stress and provide relaxation opportunities. Objective: Firstly, we aimed to determine which sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics were associated with changes in exposure to nature during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal and Spain. Secondly, we sought to estimate the associations of these changes with mental health, and test whether these associations differed according to sociodemographic characteristics and between the two countries, which experienced different restrictions and epidemiological situations. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and May 6, 2020, using an online questionnaire to measure changes in exposure to nature (including private green space and other greenery, views of nature from home and public natural spaces); sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics; stress levels (visual stress scale); psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire - 12 items) and somatization (somatization scale). Adjusted regression models were fitted to estimate associations. Results: This study included 3157 participants (1638 from Portugal, 1519 from Spain). In Portugal, maintaining/ increasing the use of public natural spaces during the lockdown was associated with lower levels of stress (adjusted beta -0.29; 95%CI -0.49, -0.08) and maintaining/increasing the frequency of viewing nature from home was associated with reduced psychological distress (0.27; -0.51, -0.03), somatization (-0.79; -1.39, -0.20), and stress levels (-0.48; -0.74, -0.23). In Spain, maintaining/increasing contact with private green space and greenery was associated with lower stress levels: for contact with indoor plants (-0.52; -0.96, -0.07) and for use of private community green spaces (-0.82; -1.61, -0.03). Conclusion: Exposure to nature was associated with better mental health outcomes during lockdowns, but the natural features associated with improved mental health differed between the two countries. Nature should be incorporated into urban planning interventions and housing design and exposure to nature should be promoted during lockdowns.",2021,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,154,,,WOS:000670068400007,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106664,,#387,Ribeiro 2021,
"The Urban Built Environment, Walking and Mental Health Outcomes Among Older Adults: A Pilot Study","Roe, J; Mondschein, A; Neale, C; Barnes, L; Boukhechba, M; Lopez, S","The benefits of walking in older age include improved cognitive health (e.g., mental alertness, improved memory functioning) and a reduced risk of stress, depression and dementia. However, research capturing the benefits of walking among older people in real-time as they navigate their world is currently very limited. This study explores cognitive health and well-being outcomes in older people as they walk in their local neighborhood environment. Residents from an independent living facility for older people (mean age 65,n= 11) walked from their home in two dichotomous settings, selected on the basis of significantly different infrastructure, varying levels of noise, traffic and percentage of green space. Employing a repeated-measures, cross over design, participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups, and walked on different days in an urban busy ""gray"" district (a busy, built up commercial street) vs. an urban quiet ""green"" district (a quiet residential area with front gardens and street trees). Our study captured real-time air quality and noise data using hand-held Airbeam sensors and physiologic health data using a smart watch to capture heart rate variability (a biomarker of stress). Cognitive health outcome measures were a pre- and post-walk short cognitive reaction time (SRT) test and memory recall of the route walked (captured via a drawn mental map). Emotional well-being outcomes were a pre- and post-walk mood scale capturing perceived stress, happiness and arousal levels. Findings showed significant positive health benefits from walking in the urban green district on emotional well-being (happiness levels) and stress physiology (p< 0.05), accompanied by faster cognitive reaction times post-walk, albeit not statistically significant in this small sample. Cognitive recall of the route varied between urban gray and urban green conditions, as participants were more likely to rely on natural features to define their routes when present. The environmental and physiologic data sets were converged to show a significant effect of ambient noise and urban conditions on stress activation as measured by heart rate variability. Findings are discussed in relation to the complexity of combining real-time environmental and physiologic data and the implications for follow-on studies. Overall, our study demonstrates the viability of using older people as citizen scientists in the capture of environmental and physiologic stress data and establishes a new protocol for exploring relationships between the built environment and cognitive health in older people.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,8,,,WOS:000575470800001,10.3389/fpubh.2020.575946,,#388,Roe 2020,

"Urban-greenway factors' influence on older adults' psychological well-being: A case study of Taichung, Taiwan","Chang, PJ; Tsou, CW; Li, YS","In Taiwan, about 80 Woof the population lives in urban areas, and as the number of older adults inches toward 20% of the total population by 2026, Taiwan is expected to become a super-aged society. Because urban green spaces are critical for maintaining older adults' physio-psychological health, maintenance of these spaces can assist the aging-in-place process. Urban greenways not only provide physical environments that support leisure activities, but also create a social environment in which older adults can develop place attachment. These areas improve older adults' psychological well-being. By contrast, urban environmental stressors (e.g., noise and air pollution) may affect older residents' well-being negatively. Therefore, this study developed a structural equation model to examine the relationship between physical environment and well-being from urban greenways in Taichung, and it examined how local older residents' place attachment and perceived environmental stressors influence this relationship. Our dataset included 13 greenways and 769 participants older than 55 living in the vicinity of these greenways. The results indicate that participants perceive lower levels of environmental stress when their local greenway quality is better, enhancing levels of well-being and place attachment, as reported by older adult residents. Since urban greenways are linear public spaces adjacent to roads, greenway designers and planners should place more emphasis on environmental quality to help create high-quality and easy-to-maintain public spaces where older adults can enjoy the outdoors and improve their well-being without worrying about environmental stressors.",2020,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,49,,,WOS:000524972100036,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126606,,#394,Chang 2020,

Our study assessed the relationship between the natural environments of residential neighbourhoods and the emotional health of adolescents living in urban New Zealand. Data from 4575 adolescents were drawn from the 2012 wave of the Youth2000 survey series. Emotional health was assessed using the World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index and depressive symptoms were measured using the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale-short form. Measures of greenness, vegetation diversity, blue spaces, and a composite available nature index were calculated for participant residential neighbourhoods (within 400 m, 800 m, and 1600 m of the residential address). Cross-classified multilevel linear models were used to assess relationships between each natural environment exposure and each emotional health outcome, and adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, household deprivation, and neighbourhood deprivation. Results showed significant relationships between reduced depressive symptoms and increased mean greenness, presence of native vegetation, and having a higher nature availability index. Unexpectedly, greater variability in greenness was associated with reduced wellbeing.

Heterogeneity in the subjective well-being impact of access to urban green space,"Sharifi, F; Nygaard, A; Stone, WM","There is a growing body of literature on the impact of urban green space (UGS) on residents' subjective wellbeing (SWB). However, few studies analyze how SWB impacts of UGS may depend on the quality aspects of UGS, and even fewer studies analyze how impacts may vary across the different levels of SWB. Drawing on individual data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey over 2001-17 for Melbourne, this paper estimates a set of hedonic models of SWB to explain the heterogeneity in SWB impacts of UGS. The results show that the size of UGS matters and that UGS impact on SWB varies considerably across different well-being levels. Specifically, individuals with low levels of SWB, overall, demonstrate much less responsiveness to proximity to UGS than individuals with high levels of SWB. Unless combined with other determinants of SWB, we argue that conventional interpretations of urban planning ideals may exacerbate, rather than mitigate, social well-being inequality. Moreover, the design of UGS, such as green corridors, can help to emulate well-being enhancing dimensions of UGS in already built-up areas.",2021,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,74,,,WOS:000724523300003,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103244,,#415,Sharifi 2021,
The good things in urban nature: A thematic framework for optimising urban planning for nature connectedness,"McEwan, K; Ferguson, FJ; Richardson, M; Cameron, R","Green interventions which connect people with nature to improve wellbeing are increasingly being applied to tackle the current crisis in mental health. A novel Smartphone app intervention was evaluated amongst adults (n = 228) including (n = 53) adults with common mental health problems, with the aim to improve wellbeing through noticing the good things about urban nature. The app prompted participants once a day over 7 days to write notes about the good things they noticed in urban green spaces. Notes were thematically analysed and ten themes emerged. The three themes with the greatest representation were: i) wonder at encountering wildlife in day-to-day urban settings; ii) appreciation of street trees; and iii) awe at colourful, expansive, dramatic skies and views. Through combining the above themes with the pathways to nature connectedness this paper provides an extended framework of activities to inform activity programming, nature engagement media content, and 'green health' interventions. Moreover, the findings have strong implications for optimising city planning, design and management for the wellbeing of both humans and wildlife.",2020,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,194,,,WOS:000500372000005,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103687,,#417,McEwan 2020,
Designing Urban Green Spaces for Older Adults in Asian Cities,"Tan, Z; Lau, KKL; Roberts, AC; Chao, STY; Ng, E","Elderly populations in Asian countries are expected to increase rapidly in the next few decades. Older adults, particularly in high-density cities, spend a considerable amount of time in urban green spaces (UGSs). The World Health Organization noted that UGSs are key to improving the age-friendliness of neighborhoods. Thus, it is necessary to design UGSs for the promotion of healthy ageing to enhance preventive healthcare and relieve medical burdens. This study conducted interviews using a questionnaire with a sample size of 326 participants in the cities of Hong Kong (China) and Tainan (Taiwan region). The inter-relationships among the design of UGSs (e.g., spatial distribution and accessibility, characteristics of plants and UGSs), older adults' perceptions on safety and aesthetics quality of UGSs, and their self-reported health conditions (assessed by the self-reported SF-12v2 Health Survey) were investigated with bivariate Spearman rank correlation tests. The results indicate that the duration of visits to UGSs was positively associated with mental health and social functioning, two subscales evaluating health-related quality of life in SF 12v2. The statistical model (moderation analysis) showed that such a correlation was especially significant in women and those with low social support and social capital. A positive relationship was found between the physical health subscale and perceived safety in UGSs. This relationship was stronger among older adults living alone (moderation analysis). Furthermore, the color of plants and maintenance condition of UGSs were significant aspects affecting the subjective assessment of aesthetic quality. This study provides useful information regarding how to plan and design urban green spaces with certain characteristics that could improve the accessibility and aesthetic quality, which are preferred by older adults.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,22,,WOS:000502057400120,10.3390/ijerph16224423,,#421,Tan 2019,

Exposure to public natural space as a protective factor for emotional well-being among young people in Canada,"Huynh, Q; Craig, W; Janssen, I; Pickett, W","Background: Positive emotional well-being is fundamentally important to general health status, and is linked to many favorable health outcomes. There is societal interest in understanding determinants of emotional well-being in adolescence, and the natural environment represents one potential determinant. Psychological and experimental research have each shown links between exposure to nature and both stress reduction and attention restoration. Some population studies have suggested positive effects of green space on various indicators of health. However, there are limited large-scale epidemiological studies assessing this relationship, specifically for populations of young people and in the Canadian context. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between exposure to public natural space and positive emotional well-being among young adolescent Canadians.Methods: This cross-sectional study was based upon the Canadian 2009/10 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey with linked geographic information system (GIS) data. Following exclusions, the sample included 17 249 (grades 6 to 10, mostly ages 11 to 16) students from 317 schools. Features of the natural environment were extracted using GIS within a 5 km radius circular buffer surrounding each school. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the presence of public natural space (features include green and blue spaces such as parks, wooded areas, and water bodies) and students' reports of positive emotional well-being, while controlling for salient covariates and the clustered nature of the data.Results: Over half of Canadian youth reported positive emotional well-being (58.5% among boys and 51.6% among girls). Relationships between measures of natural space and positive emotional well-being were weak and lacked consistency overall, but modest protective effects were observed in small cities. Positive emotional well-being was more strongly associated with other factors including demographic characteristics, family affluence, and perceptions of neighbourhood surroundings.Conclusion: Exposure to natural space in youth's immediate living environment may not be a leading determinant of their emotional well-being. The relationship between natural space and positive emotional well-being may be context specific, and thus different for Canadian youth compared to adult populations and those studied in other nations. Factors of the individual context were stronger potential determinants.",2013,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,13,,,WOS:000318639000001,10.1186/1471-2458-13-407,,#431,Huynh 2013,
Long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces and anxiety and depression in adults: A cross-sectional study,"Gascon, M; Sanchez-Benavides, G; Dadvand, P; Martinez, D; Gramunt, N; Gotsens, X; Cirach, M; Vert, C; Molinuevo, JL; Crous-Bou, M; Nieuwenhuijsen, M","Background: Although exposure to natural outdoor environments has been consistently associated with improved perceived general health, available evidence on a protective association between this exposure and specific mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety is still limited.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medication. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential mediators and effect modifiers of this association.Methods: The study was based on an existing adult cohort (ALFA Alzheimer and Families) and includes 958 adult participants from Barcelona recruited in 2013-2014. For each participant residential green and blue exposure indicators [surrounding greenness (NDVI), amount of green (land-cover) and access to major green spaces and blue spaces] were generated for different buffers (100 m, 300 m and 500 m). Participants reported their history of doctor-diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders and intake of related medication. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the corresponding associations.Results: Increasing surrounding greenness was associated with reduced odds of self-reported history of benzodiazepines [e.g. Odds ratio - OR (95%CI) = 0.62 (0.43, 0.89) for 1-interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI in a 300 m buffer] and access to major green spaces was associated with self-reported history of depression [OR (95%CI) = 0.18 (0.06, 0.58)]. No statistically significant associations were observed with blue spaces. Air pollution (between 0.8% and 29.6%) and noise (between 2.2% and 5.3%) mediated a proportion of the associations observed, whereas physical activity and social support played a minor role.Conclusion: Our findings suggest a potential protective role of green spaces on mental health (depression and anxiety) in adults, but further studies, especially longitudinal studies, are needed to provide further evidence of these benefits and of the mediation role of exposures like air pollution and noise.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,162,,231-239,WOS:000426325300027,10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.012,,#435,Gascon 2018,
"Active and Passive Use of Green Space, Health, and Well-Being amongst University Students","Holt, EW; Lombard, QK; Best, N; Smiley-Smith, S; Quinn, JE","Frequent exposure to green space has been linked to positive health and well-being in varying populations. Yet, there is still limited research exploring the restorative benefits associated with differing types of green space use among students living in the university setting. To address this gap, we explored green space use amongst a population of undergraduate students (n = 207) attending a university with abundant opportunities to access the restorative properties of nature. The purpose of this study was to examine the type and frequency of green space interactions that are most strongly associated with indicators of health and well-being, and investigate student characteristics associated with frequent use of green space. Results revealed that students who frequently engage with green spaces in active ways report higher quality of life, better overall mood, and lower perceived stress. Passive green space interactions were not strongly associated with indicators of health and well-being. Having had daily interactions with green space in childhood was associated with frequent green space use as a university student, and identified barriers to green space use included not enough time, and not aware of opportunities These results could assist in the tailoring of green exercise interventions conducted in the university setting.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,3,,WOS:000459113600130,10.3390/ijerph16030424,,#437,Holt 2019,
How tree canopy cover can reduce urban suicide attempts: A geospatial analysis of the moderating role of area deprivation,"Lee, SM; Lee, RJ; Scherr, S","A lack of knowledge about the benefits of urban trees on mental health is addressed by exploring the association between tree canopy coverage, suicide attempts and the levels of neighborhood deprivation. Although the positive association between tree canopy cover and mental health as well as a negative association between neighborhood socioeconomic status and suicide attempts are well-known, it remains largely unclear how both area deprivation and tree canopy cover can help predicting local suicide attempts. Using the local suicide records (n = 3442) between 2015 and 2019 in the city of Cincinnati, OH, we analyzed if the number of local suicide attempts was related to the tree canopy cover at the census block group level (n = 275). After adjusting for control variables, we found that as the deprivation level gets a one-percentage point higher, the number of attempted suicide rate significantly increases by 1.05 %, while a one-percentage point increase in tree canopy coverage significantly decreases the attempted suicide rate by 0.9 %. Additionally, the level of area deprivation showed a moderating effect on the association between overall tree canopy and attempted suicide. Our findings suggest that local tree canopy cover could be a useful tool to improve local mental health including suicide attempts. More importantly, the benefit of tree canopy cover was stronger in less disadvantaged areas than in highly disadvantaged areas, which provides a new insight that interventions to qualitatively improve green space may be important for improving mental health in left-behind areas as a form of environmental justice.",2023,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,230,,,WOS:000877502200002,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104606,,#443,Lee 2023,
"The association between urban greenspace and psychological health among young adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Zewdie, HY; Whetten, K; Dubie, ME; Kenea, B; Bekele, T; Temesgen, C; Molla, W; Puffer, ES; Ostermann, J; Hobbie, AM; Gray, CL","Introduction: Psychological disorders are emerging as health priorities in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Ethiopia. Urban greenspace - parks, trees, and other vegetation integrated into urban form - may facilitate population psychological health, but is largely understudied outside high-income countries. We explore greenspace in relation to psychological health among young adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Method: Greenspace exposure was calculated using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from publicly available satellite imagery (2018-2019). We used tests of spatial clustering to characterize greenspace distribution. Derived NDVI values were linked to Positive Outcomes for Orphans study participants to explore cross-sectional associations between greenspace exposure and psychological health (measured 2019-2021). Two continuous scores of psychological health were examined: total difficulties from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and depressive symptoms from the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multilevel generalized linear regression, nested by administrative units, was used to estimate the association between greenspace and psychological health. We also explored effect modification by gender and having income. Results: We found greenspace is spatially clustered in Addis Ababa, with high greenspace density in the northeast region and low greenspace density in the center of the city. Our findings suggest residing in greener areas is associated with fewer emotional and behavioral difficulties (beta =-1.89; 95% CI:-3.50,-0.29), but not significantly associated with depressive symptomology (beta =-0.61; 95% CI:-2.33, 1.11). We observed stronger associations between greenspace and total difficulties among those reporting any income and among males, and for the association between greenspace and depression symptomology among males. Conclusion: We offer initial exploration into the role of greenspace in psychological well-being in Addis Ababa, with potential implications for urban communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. Further research should continue to explore how the built and natural environment could be leveraged in similar settings to promote population psychological health.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,215,,,WOS:000860552700013,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114258,,#455,Zewdie 2022,
Green Space and Stress: Evidence from Cortisol Measures in Deprived Urban Communities,"Roe, JJ; Thompson, CW; Aspinall, PA; Brewer, MJ; Duff, EI; Miller, D; Mitchell, R; Clow, A","Contact with green space in the environment has been associated with mental health benefits, but the mechanism underpinning this association is not clear. This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35-55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation.",2013,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,10,9,4086-4103,WOS:000328620200018,10.3390/ijerph10094086,,#465,Roe 2013,

A Quasi-experimental Study in Scotland, UK","Thompson, CW; Elizalde, A; Cummins, S; Leyland, AH; Botha, W; Briggs, A; Tilley, S; de Oliveira, ES; Roe, J; Aspinall, P; Mitchell, R","High prevalence of poor mental health is a major public health problem. Natural environments may contribute to mitigating stress and enhancing health. However, there is little evidence on whether community-level interventions intended to increase exposure to natural environments can improve mental health and related behaviours. In the first study of its kind, we evaluated whether the implementation of a programme designed to improve the quality of, and access to, local woodlands in deprived communities in Scotland, UK, was associated with lower perceived stress or other health-related outcomes, using a controlled, repeat cross-sectional design with a nested prospective cohort. Interventions included physical changes to the woodlands and community engagement activities within the woodlands, with data collected at baseline (2013) and post-intervention (2014 and 2015). The interventions were, unexpectedly, associated with increased perceived stress compared to control sites. However, we observed significantly greater increases in stress for those living >500 m from intervention sites. Visits to nearby nature (woods and other green space) increased overall, and moderate physical activity levels also increased. In the intervention communities, those who visited natural environments showed smaller increases in stress than those who did not; there was also some evidence of increased nature connectedness and social cohesion. The intervention costs were modest but there were no significant changes in quality of life on which to base cost-effectiveness. Findings suggest factors not captured in the study may have contributed to the perceived stress patterns found. Wider community engagement and longer post-intervention follow-up may be needed to achieve significant health benefits from woodland interventions such as those described here. The study points to the challenges in evidencing the effectiveness of green space and forestry interventions to enhance health in urban environments, but also to potential benefits from more integrated approaches across health and landscape planning and management practice.",2019,,SUSTAINABILITY,11,12,,WOS:000473753700087,10.3390/su11123317,,#468,Thompson 2019,
The Effects of Different Natural Environment Influences on Health and Psychological Well-Being of People: A Case Study in Selangor,"Raman, TL; Aziz, NAA; Yaakob, SSN","Background: People benefit from the recreational services provided by an urban corridor, urban park, and urban forest. Due to ongoing land-use interest and urban development, however, these natural environments are coming under increasing pressure. Simultaneously, the world is becoming increasingly urbanised, and living in cities has been linked to mental health issues. On the other hand, different natural environments are known to create healthier environments, and the need for effective restorative environments has never been greater. The purpose of the study was to compare the impacts of walking in different natural environments. Methods: I) Kota Damansara Community Forest Reserve, II) Mutiara Damansara Recreational Park, and III) the Urban Green Corridor along Jalan PJU 7/2 were used as control study sites in this study. Each site was visited only once by the study participants (40 women and 40 men). Walking for 30 min was a part of the experiment. To identify the psychological effects of different natural environments, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Restoration Outcome Scale (ROS) were utilised. Results: In all three natural environments, the restorative effects were found to increase significantly. Conclusion: The overall conclusion of the field experiment is that being in an urban green corridor can also provide a refreshing environment. In terms of stress reduction among working adults, the recreational park is sufficient, while urban-forested areas are more effective in improving mental health by minimising stress, anxiety, and depression.",2021,,SUSTAINABILITY,13,15,,WOS:000682263500001,10.3390/su13158597,,#472,Raman 2021,
Associations between greenspace and mental health prescription rates in urban areas,"Roberts, M; Irvine, KN; McVittie, A","Urban greenspace is often associated with improved mental health, particularly in urban areas, with studies typically carried out at town or city scales. Population level models enable us to extend the understanding of the relationship between mental health and urban greenspace to the national level, with relevance to national level policy and funding decision making. We used linear mixed effects models to investigate the relationship between urban greenspace availability measured at two scales (immediate neighbourhood and within 30 min walk) and prescription rates to treat mental health disorders across all Scottish settlements with over 10,000 residents. We incorporated socio-demographic and area-level covariates shown to be related to mental health and/or greenspace use and corrected for spatial autocorrelation and potential impacts of health boards. Within the immediate neighbourhood we estimated a significant relationship between mental health and urban greenspace in areas with high proportions of individuals identifying as part of a Black and Minority Ethnic group and/or a high proportion of households deprived in more than two dimensions. In these areas higher greenspace was associated with lower prescription rates. When considering greenspace within 30 min walk, no significant relationship was estimated between greenspace and mental health disorders. Our results highlight that the relationship between greenspace and mental health relies not only on the presence of greenspace itself, but also on the characteristics of the population using the greenspace. Although aggregated secondary data does not allow us to make inferences around an individual's relationship to greenspace, population level models as presented here provide valuable information to urban and land use planning, where decisions are taken at the population level.",2021,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,64,,,WOS:000692536200005,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127301,,#473,Roberts 2021,

Species richness is positively related to mental health - A study for Germany,"Methorst, J; Bonn, A; Marselle, M; Bohning-Gaese, K; Rehdanz, K","Nature benefits human health. To date, however, little is known whether biodiversity relates to human health. While some local and city level studies show that species diversity, as a measure of biodiversity, can have positive effects, there is a lack of studies about the relationship between different species diversity measures and human health, especially at larger spatial scales. Here, we conduct cross-sectional analyses of the association between species diversity and human health across Germany, while controlling for socio-economic factors and other nature characteristics. As indicators for human health, we use the mental (MCS) and physical health (PCS) component scales of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP, Short Form Health Questionnaire ? SF12). For species diversity, we use species richness and abundance estimates of two species groups: plants and birds. We phrase the following hypotheses: plant and bird species are positively associated with mental and physical health (H1 & H3); bird abundance is positively related to mental health (H2). Our results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between plant and bird species richness and mental health across all model variations controlling for a multitude of other factors. These results highlight the importance for species diversity for people?s mental health and well-being. Therefore, policy makers, landscape planners and greenspace managers on the local and national level should consider supporting biodiverse environments to promote mental health and wellbeing.

Given the difference in utilization of green spaces in countries with agriculturally heavy economies such as Indonesia, the effects of green space remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between green space exposure and depressive disorders, focusing on Indonesia. Depressive disorders data provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation was used. Exposure to the green space was based on the normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS-NDVI) and green land-cover data provided by the Geospatial Information Agency of Indonesia. A generalized additive mixed model was conducted, followed by a sensitivity test and positive-negative control analysis, to evaluate the as-sociation. Stratified analysis was employed to assess the effects of green space on depressive disorders in areas with different levels of urbanization. Exposure to green space significantly reduced the risk of depressive dis-orders by up to 5% per interquartile unit increment of NDVI. Moreover, there was a 12.4% reduced risk of depressive disorders coinciding with an 8.4% increase in the proportion of forest and total vegetation. In high-urbanization areas, the results of sensitivity analysis illustrated that green spaces reduced the risk of depressive disorders by 10%.

Do seasons matter? Exploring the dynamic link between blue-green space and mental restoration,"Zhou, Y; Yang, LQ; Yu, JN; Guo, SY","In the face of the increasing mental health crisis, there is a growing awareness of the benefits of natural environments, especially urban blue-green spaces in promoting mental health. However, most studies neglected the dynamics of blue-green space over the seasons and the dynamic effects on mental restoration. In addition, the access to nature can be quantified from multiple dimensions, but few studies have measured the specific characteristics (such as revetment type, distance from water, and width of field view) of blue-green space as visitors experienced. To fill these gaps, we conducted a field investigation in 18 selected blue-green spaces in winter and summer, examining the dynamic relationship between blue-green space and mental restoration. A total of 915 samples was collected through questionnaires. The results indicated that the impact of blue-green space on mental restoration varies with the seasons, for example, green space significantly promoted physical activity in summer, but not in winter, and blue space inhibited physical activity more significantly in summer. Moreover, the overall results suggested that blue space did not directly promote the improvement of visitors' mental health, but improved social interaction, while green space had a direct positive influence on mental restoration. This study explored the dynamic link between blue-green space and mental restoration over different seasons, expanding the potential characteristics of blue-green space that affecting visitors' mental restoration, and contributing to our knowledge of the health benefits of visiting blue-green spaces.",2022,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,73,,,WOS:000866527200004,10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127612,,#487,Zhou 2022,
Park availability and major depression in individuals with chronic conditions: Is there an association in urban India?,"Mukherjee, D; Safraj, S; Tayyab, M; Shivashankar, R; Patel, SA; Narayanan, G; Ajay, VS; Ali, MK; Narayan, KMV; Tandon, N; Prabhakaran, D","Green space exposure has been positively correlated with better mental-health indicators in several high income countries, but has not been examined in low-and middle-income countries undergoing rapid urbanization. Building on a study of mental health in adults with a pre-existing chronic condition, we examined the association between park availability and major depression among 1208 adults surveyed in Delhi, India. Major depression was measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The ArcGIS platform was used to quantify park availability indexed as (i) park distance from households, (ii) area of the nearest park; and within one km buffer area around households - the (iii) number and (iv) total area of all parks. Mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics indicated that relative to residents exposed to the largest nearest park areas (tertile 3), the odds [95% confidence interval] of major depression was 3.1 [1.4-7.0] times higher among residents exposed to the smallest nearest park areas (tertile 1) and 2.1 [0.9-4.8] times higher in residents with mid-level exposure (tertile 2). There was no statistically significant association between other park variables tested and major depression. We hypothesized that physical activity in the form of walking, perceived stress levels and satisfaction with the neighborhood environment may have mediating effects on the association between nearest park area and major depression. We found no significant mediation effects for any of our hypothesized variables. In conclusion, our results provide preliminary and novel evidence from India that availability of large parks in the immediate neighborhood positively impacts mental well-being of individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions, at the opportune time when India is embarking on the development of sustainable cities that aim to promote health through smart urban design - one of the key elements of which is the inclusion of urban green spaces.",2017,,HEALTH & PLACE,47,,54-62,WOS:000410785700007,10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.07.004,,#492,Mukherjee 2017,
The Effects of Exercise and Social Interaction in Different Natural Environments on the Mental Health of Urban Residents,"Song, YT; Lin, XF","Background: Together with the rapid development of China's economy, the number of urban residents suffering from depression and psychological disorders has been increasing as a result of the general increase in life stress. As a consequence, this study investigates the effects on users' mental health through exercise and social interaction in three different outdoor natural landscapes, and provides theoretical and practical guidance for urban landscape planning and design. Methods: In this study, pre- and post-DASS21 (depression, anxiety and stress) data were obtained by using the DASS21 scale (used to assess depression, anxiety, and stress) to test a population of users performing simple exercise and social interactions in three natural environments, and the data scale values were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Results: (1) In the natural outdoor environment within the community, there was a relationship between the outdoor environment and perceived atmospheric temperature, with (single) and (group) perceived outdoor temperatures in the community having smaller effects on the mood of community residents; (2) After analyzing the data by descriptive statistics (p < 0.05), it was found that there was a slight change in the mean scores both before the participants climbed Yuelu Mountain and after they reached the summit; the mean scores of stress, anxiety, and depression decreased after they reached the summit, and the condition improved; (3) There was a slight change in the mean of both scores before the departure to and after the return from the Tongguan Kiln attractions, with a slight improvement in the condition after the return of the stress and depression mean scores. Conclusions: Enhancing social relationships through exercise and social interaction in a natural environment in different populations significantly increases the benefits for mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress) and assists recovery from stress-related mental disorders. Different landscape types and landscape attribute characteristics have different effects on urban residents' preferences and mental health. Rich natural landscapes, providing green exercise environments, and t social interactions have positive effects on the mental health of urban residents. Especially in environments where the change in altitude is around 200 m, climbing is very beneficial to psychological emotions.",2022,,SUSTAINABILITY,14,21,,WOS:000881504100001,10.3390/su142114095,,#493,Song 2022,
"Effects of the Combination of Audio and Visual Factors on Mental Restoration in a Large-Scale Urban Greenway: Perspectives from Wuhan, China","Guo, SY; Zhou, Y; Yu, JN; Yang, LQ","The natural environment has been widely recognized as an important way of alleviating mental disorders. While a growing number of studies have discussed the restorative effect of the natural environment, the role of sounds in the natural environment (i.e., soundscape) on promoting mental restoration is under limited exploration. Therefore, we examined the restorative effect of visual stimuli and the combination of audio and visual factors in the natural environment. A total of 149 college students were divided into five groups, and exposed to different combinations of photos and sounds (with 'silence' as a control group) collected along the East Lake Greenway-the longest urban greenway in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the correlation between characteristics of the natural environment and volunteers' mental restoration, with place attachment as a mediator. Results showed that: (1) sound can alter the effect of visual factors on mental restoration; (2) birdsong can significantly enhance the restorative benefit of urban greenways; (3) an environment that is covered in greenery and consists of water sounds will contribute to a higher level of mental restoration; (4) human noise will have a negative impact on mental restoration; (5) place attachment is a mediator between the natural environment and mental restoration. This study highlights the effectiveness of sounds in the natural environment in promoting mental restoration, and broadens our understanding of the link between the natural environment and mental health. We propose that not only visual factors, but also audio-visual combinations, should be considered when creating restorative environments.",2022,,LAND,11,11,,WOS:000895567600001,10.3390/land11112017,,#497,Guo 2022,
"Are Rurality, Area Deprivation, Access to Outside Space, and Green Space Associated with Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Cross Sectional Study (CHARIS-E)","Hubbard, G; den Daas, C; Johnston, M; Murchie, P; Thompson, CW; Dixon, D","The study investigated if rurality, area deprivation, access to outside space (Study 1), and frequency of visiting and duration in green space (Study 2) are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined if individual demographics (age, gender, COVID-19 shielding status) and illness beliefs have a direct association with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults was conducted in Scotland during June and July 2020. If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics, illness beliefs, and the following characteristics: Rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect were conducted. There were 2969 participants in Study 1, of which 1765 (59.6%) were female, 349 (11.9%) were in the shielding category, and the median age was 54 years. There were 502 participants in Study 2, of which 295 (58.60%) were female, 58 (11.6%) were in shielding category, and the median age was 53 years. Direct effects showed that psychological distress was worse if participants reported the following: Urban, in a deprived area, no access to or sharing residential outside space, fewer visits to green space (environment), younger, female, in the shielding category (demographics), worse illness (COVID-19) representations, and greater threat perception (illness beliefs).

Natural surroundings in childhood are associated with lower schizophrenia rates,"Engemann, K; Svenning, JC; Arge, L; Brandt, J; Geels, C; Mortensen, PB; Plana-Ripoll, O; Tsirogiannis, C; Pedersen, CB","High exposure to green space and natural environments has previously been associated with lower schizophrenia rates possibly through low air pollution and improved psychological restoration. Exposure to natural environments could explain the negative urban-rural gradient of schizophrenia, but it is unclear if all natural environments are associated with schizophrenia rates. We investigated the association between schizophrenia and growing up surrounded by environments classified as mainly urban, agricultural, near-natural green space, and blue space. Vegetation density and air pollution were assessed as potential pathways. We used the Danish population (943 027 people) and remotely-sensed environmental data to determine land cover exposure and vegetation density around each individual's residence. Effect sizes were estimated using Cox regression and adjusted for air pollution, socioeconomic status, and urbanization. Our results show that growing up surrounded by non-urban environments is associated with lower schizophrenia rates. Firstly, growing up surrounded by non-built-up areas (agricultural areas, near-natural green and blue space) is associated with lower schizophrenia rates compared to urban areas. Secondly, rates decrease with vegetation density in a dose-response relationship for urban and agricultural areas. Air pollution mitigation more strongly explained the protective association in near-natural green spaces, implying that restorative pathways together with air pollution mitigation may explain lower rates in natural environments. This study suggests that ensuring access to natural environments during childhood may be important for schizophrenia prevention, whilst being the first study to show that natural environments may influence schizophrenia rates through multiple pathways.

Urban residential greenspace and mental health in youth: Different approaches to testing multiple pathways yield different conclusions,"Dzhambov, A; Hartig, T; Markevych, I; Tilov, B; Dimitrova, D","Background: Urban greenspace can benefit mental health through multiple mechanisms. They may work together, but previous studies have treated them as independent.Objectives: We aimed to compare single and parallel mediation models, which estimate the independent contributions of different paths, to several models that posit serial mediation components in the pathway from greenspace to mental health.Methods: We collected cross-sectional survey data from 399 participants (15-25 years of age) in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Objective ""exposure"" to urban residential greenspace was defined by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, tree cover density within the 500-m buffer, and Euclidean distance to the nearest urban greenspace. Self-reported measures of availability, access, quality, and usage of greenspace were also used. Mental health was measured with the General Health Questionnaire. The following potential mediators were considered in single and parallel mediation models: restorative quality of the neighborhood, neighborhood social cohesion, commuting and leisure time physical activity, road traffic noise annoyance, and perceived air pollution. Four models were tested with the following serial mediation components: (1) restorative quality -> social cohesion; (2) restorative quality -> physical activity; (3) perceived traffic pollution -> restorative quality; (4) and noise annoyance -> physical activity.Results: There was no direct association between objectively-measured greenspace and mental health. For the 500-m buffer, the tests of the single mediator models suggested that restorative quality mediated the relationship between NDVI and mental health. Tests of parallel mediation models did not find any significant indirect effects. In line with theory, tests of the serial mediation models showed that higher restorative quality was associated with more physical activity and more social cohesion, and in turn with better mental health. As for self-reported greenspace measures, single mediation through restorative quality was significant only for time in greenspace, and there was no mediation though restorative quality in the parallel mediation models; however, serial mediation through restorative quality and social cohesion/physical activity was indicated for all self-reported measures except for greenspace quality.Conclusions: Statistical models should adequately address the theoretically indicated interdependencies between mechanisms underlying association between greenspace and mental health. If such causal relationships hold, testing mediators alone or in parallel may lead to incorrect inferences about the relative contribution of specific paths, and thus to inappropriate intervention strategies.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,160,,47-59,WOS:000417548600007,10.1016/j.envres.2017.09.015,,#504,Dzhambov 2018,
"Exposure to natural space, sense of community belonging, and adverse mental health outcomes across an urban region","Rugel, EJ; Carpiano, RM; Henderson, SB; Brauer, M","In a rapidly urbanizing world, identifying evidence-based strategies to support healthy design is essential. Although urban living offers increased access to critical resources and can help to mitigate climate change, densely populated neighborhood environments are often higher in many of the physical and psychological stressors that are detrimental to health, and lower in the social capital that is beneficial to health. One component of urban form that can reduce these stressors and improve social capital is nature: greenspace, such as parks and street trees, and bluespace, such as rivers and oceans. In this project, we applied measures from a Natural Space Index previously developed for the Vancouver, Canada census metropolitan area to explore the relationship between distinct measures of natural space and prevalence of (1) major depressive disorder, (2) negative mental health, and (3) psychological distress. In addition, we examined direct associations between natural space exposure and neighborhood social capital, as measured via self-reported sense of community belonging (SoC), as well as the potential mental health benefits of natural space mediated via SoC. Using data from the population-based, cross-sectional 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (weighted n = 1,930,048), we found no direct associations between any measure of natural space and mental health in models adjusted for 11 demographic, socioeconomic, household arrangement, health, and urban design variables. However, publicly accessible neighborhood nature was associated with increased odds of higher SoC. A 1% increase in the percentage of natural space (combined greenspace and bluespace) within 500 m had an odds ratio [95% confidence interval] of 1.05 [1.00, 1.10] for very strong vs. very weak SoC and 1.04 [1.01, 1.08] for somewhat strong vs. very weak SoC. In addition, higher levels of SoC were associated with improvements in all three mental health outcomes. Mediation tests indicated significant indirect effects of both publicly accessible neighborhood nature variables on reductions in psychological distress and reduced odds of negative mental health via increased sense of SoC. This suggests that natural space has the potential to address the pressing issue of social isolation and, in turn, poor mental health faced by residents of dense urban environments.",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,171,,365-377,WOS:000460081300041,10.1016/j.envres.2019.01.034,,#506,Rugel 2019,
Urban residential quarter green space and life satisfaction,"Jiang, YQ; Huang, GL","Urban green space is important for residents' well-being, improving their physical health, psychological wellbeing, social benefits, and life satisfaction. Residential quarter, a gated dwelling unit with one or several residential buildings and public infrastructures shared by all residents, is a common form of residence in densely populated cities. Residential quarter green space (RQGS) is conveniently accessible to all the residents. While existing studies have investigated many types of green spaces in cities, RQGS has been overlooked to some extent. To fill this gap, we asked three questions: 1) How often do residents use RQGS? 2) How does the RQGS use frequency contribute to residents' life satisfaction? And 3) What factors may influence their RQGS use frequency? We surveyed 7326 respondents in 78 residential quarters in Beijing, China, and recorded main characteristics of green space in these residential quarters. We employed multinomial logistic regression analysis and multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis. The results show that 84.7 % of the total respondents used RQGS at least once a week. Using RQGS at least once a week was associated with higher level of life satisfaction, which was on a scale of 1-10 where one means 'not at all satisfied' to ten means 'completely satisfied'. Respondents using RQGS at least once a week were nearly 1.5 times more likely to rank life satisfaction at 8 (OR = 0.679, p < 0.01) and 9 (OR = 0.671, p < 0.01), and 1.3 times to rank at 10 (OR = 0.755, p < 0.05). Having an open space for multiple activities, a pavilion, or a shaded trail will greatly increase likelihood to use RQGS at least once a week. In addition, separating ground traffic and parking from public green space also contribute to attract more frequent users to green space in residential quarters. These findings contribute to our understanding of RQGS and would help to guide its design and management in the future.",2022,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,69,,,WOS:000789606300002,10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127510,,#507,Jiang 2022,
"Neighbourhood blue space, health and wellbeing: The mediating role of different types of physical activity","Pasanen, TP; White, MP; Wheeler, BW; Garrett, JK; Elliott, LR","Background: Evidence suggests that living near blue spaces such as the coast, lakes and rivers may be good for health and wellbeing. Although greater levels of physical activity (PA) may be a potential mechanism, we know little about the types of PA that might account for this.Objectives: To explore the mediating role of: a) 'watersports' (e.g. sailing/canoeing); b) 'on-land outdoor PA' in natural/mixed settings (e.g. walking/running/cycling); and, c) 'indoor/other PA' (e.g. gym/squash) in the relationships between residential blue space availability and health outcomes.Methods: Using data from the Health Survey for England (n = 21,097), we constructed a path model to explore whether weekly volumes of each PA type mediate any of the relationships between residential blue space availability (coastal proximity and presence of freshwater) and self-reported general and mental health, controlling for green space density and a range of socio-economic factors at the individual- and area-level.Results: Supporting predictions, living nearer the coast was associated with better self-reported general and mental health and this was partially mediated by on-land outdoor PA (primarily walking). Watersports were more common among those living within 5kms of the coast, but did not mediate associations between coastal proximity and health. Presence of freshwater in the neighbourhood was associated with better mental health, but this effect was not mediated by PA.Conclusions: Although nearby blue spaces offer potentially easier access to watersports, relatively few individuals in England engage in them and thus they do not account for positive population health associations. Rather, the benefits to health from coastal living seem, at least in part, due to participation in land-based outdoor activities (especially walking). Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms behind the relationship between freshwater presence and mental health.",2019,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,131,,,WOS:000493550200068,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105016,,#510,Pasanen 2019,
Physiological and psychological effects of visits to different urban green and street environments in older people: A field experiment in a dense inner-city area,"Kabisch, N; Puffel, C; Masztalerz, O; Hemmerling, J; Kraemer, R","Urbanisation and global ageing are both accelerating, posing older people's mental and cardiovascular health at risk. A growing number of studies suggests beneficial health effects when having contact with urban green spaces. This study investigates the effects of short-term exposure of older people to different urban green and street environments on physiological and psychological parameters relevant for cardiovascular health. A sample of 33 older men and women (mean age 63.5, standard deviation 4.2) was exposed to a long-standing urban park with widespread and old trees, to a newly developed park with diverse use opportunities and a busy street environment in the inner city of Leipzig, Germany. We measured heart rate variability using continuous ECG monitoring, blood pressure, mood using psychological questionnaires and perceived outcomes of restoration. We found significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure in the long-standing park indicating protective effects on cardiovascular health. Significant decreases in heart rate variability parameters were observed in the dense urban street environment indicating adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Level of naturalness and restoration experience were perceived highest in the old park reflecting common theories of restoration. In the light of these results, visiting urban green spaces should be considered as a valuable preventive measure for promoting cardiovascular health especially in older people.

Green space as a buffer between stressful life events and health,"van den Berg, AE; Maas, J; Verheij, RA; Groenewegen, PP","This study investigates whether the presence of green space can attenuate negative health impacts of stressful life events. Individual-level data on health and socio-demographic characteristics were drawn from a representative two-stage sample of 4529 Dutch respondents to the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP-2), conducted in 2000-2002. Health measures included: (1) the number of health complaints in the last 14 days; (2) perceived mental health (measured by the GHQ-12): and (3) a single item measure of perceived general health ranging from 'excellent' to 'poor'. Percentages of green space in a 1-km and 3-km radius around the home were derived from the 2001 National Land cover Classification database (LGN4). Data were analysed using multilevel regression analysis, with GP practices as the group-level units. All analyses were controlled for age, gender, income, education level, and level of urbanity. The results show that the relationships of stressful life events with number of health complaints and perceived general health were significantly moderated by amount of green space in a 3-km radius. Respondents with a high amount of green space in a 3-km radius were less affected by experiencing a stressful life event than respondents with a low amount of green space in this radius. The same pattern was observed for perceived mental health, although it was marginally significant. The moderating effects of green space were found only for green space within 3 km, and not for green space within 1 km of residents' homes, presumably because the 3-km indicator is more affected by the presence of larger areas of green space, that are supposed to sustain deeper forms of restoration. These results support the notion that green space can provide a buffer against the negative health impact of stressful life events. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of exposure to green space with multiple syndromes of behavioural development in preschool children.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Wuhan, China from April 2016 to June 2018. We recruited a sample of 6039 children aged 5-6 years from 17 kindergartens located in five urban districts of the city. We measured the greenness using average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within a circular buffer area of 100 metres surrounding the central point of residences and kindergartens. We calculated the residence-kindergarten-weighted greenness by assuming that children spent 16 hours per day at home and 8 hours at kindergarten. The problem behaviours of children were evaluated at kindergarten using the Childhood Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and standardized into problem behavioural T scores. Linear mixed-effect models and linear-regression models were used to estimate the associations.Results: We observed decreases in problem behaviours associated with kindergarten and residence-kindergarten-weighted surrounding greenness in preschool children. For example, a one-interquartile range increase in kindergarten and residence-kindergartenweighted NDVI was associated with decreased T scores for total behaviour by -0.61 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.09, -0.13) and -0.49 (95% CI -0.85, -0.12), anxiety and depression by -0.65 (95% CI: -1.13, -0.17) and -0.46 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.10), aggressive behaviour by -0.53 (95% CI: -1.01, -0.05) and -0.38 (95% CI: -0.75, -0.02) and hyperactivity and attention deficit by -0.54 (95% CI: -1.01, -0.07) and -0.48 (95% CI: -0.83, -0.12), respectively.

"Greener living environment healthier people? Exploring green space, physical activity and health in the Doetinchem Cohort Study","Picavet, HSJ; Milder, I; Kruize, H; de Vries, S; Hermans, T; Wendel-Vos, W","Background. Evidence is emerging that more green space in the living environment is associated with better health, partly via the pathway of physical activity. Objectives. We explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between green space and physical activity and several health indicators in the Doetinchem Cohort Study.Methods. A random sample of men and women aged 20-59 years at baseline was measured max 5 times with 5 year-intervals in the period 1987-2012. Data of round 3-5 were used. Measurements were based on examinations (height, weight, blood pressure) or questionnaires (physical activity, perceived health, depressive symptoms, chronic conditions). The percentage of green space (mainly urban and agricultural green) around the home address (125 m and 1 km) was calculated using satellite data.Results. More agricultural green was associated with less time spent on bicycling (beta 1 km = -0.15, 95% CL -0.13; -0.04) and sports (beta 1 km = -0.04, 95% CL -0.07; -0.01) and more time spent on gardening (beta 1 km = 0.16, 95% CL 0.12; 0.19) and odd jobs (beta 1 km = 0.10, 95% CL 0.05; 0.15), and this was in the other direction for urban green. For only a few of the many health indicators a positive association with green was found, and mainly for total green within 1 km radius. Longstanding green or a transition to more green did not show more pronounced associations with health. Conclusions. For the green space range of the Doetinchem area the findings do not strongly support the hypothesis that the percentage of green in the living environment affects health positively. The distinction by type of green may, however, be relevant for physical activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Residential exposure to green space and early childhood neurodevelopment,"Liao, JQ; Zhang, B; Xia, W; Cao, ZQ; Zhang, YM; Liang, SW; Hu, K; Xu, SQ; Li, YY","Background: A few studies reported that exposure to high levels of residential surrounding green spaces was associated with better cognitive development in primary school children. However, no studies have been conducted to examine such association in early childhood.Objectives: We investigated the association between residential exposure to green space and early childhood neurodevelopment, and further explored the mediation effects of traffic-related air pollution and maternal physical activity on this association.Methods: We enrolled 1312 pregnant women between January 2012 and October 2015 and their children were followed up until an age of 2 years. We measured residential exposure to green space by calculating averaged normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within a 300 meter buffer area surrounding residential address at birth. The neurodevelopment, which included mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI), was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development for each child at about 24 months. The associations of residential exposure to NDVI with early childhood MDI score and PDI score were evaluated using multiple linear regression models. The mediation effects of traffic-related air pollution and maternal physical activities on those associations were estimated by causal mediation analyses.Results: Exposure to higher levels of residential surrounding green spaces was associated with increased early childhood PDI score (adjusted changes for one SD increment of NDVI: 3.28 (95% CI: 2.15, 4.41)) and MDI score (adjusted changes for one SD increment of NDVI: 1.97 (95% CI: 0.63, 3.30). These associations were more pronounced in children of mothers whose pre-pregnancy BMI were lower than 24 kg/m(2). Further mediation analyses indicated that reduced levels of traffic-related air pollution explained 13.6% to 28.0% of the association between exposure to green space and early childhood PDI score.Conclusion: Exposure to higher levels of residential surrounding green spaces was associated with better early childhood neurodevelopment.

The influence of greenspace characteristics and building configuration on depression in the elderly,"Wu, ZF; Ren, Y","The positive effects of natural landscapes, including green and blue spaces, have been widely documented on the psychological well-being of urban citizens; however, there is limited information on the effect of artificial landscapes, despite being significant components of urban landscapes. This study aimed to explore how the characteristics of green and blue spaces and building configuration are correlated with the mental health status of residents in Beijing, China. The mental health status of 757 citizens aged over 60 was obtained through questionnaires using GDS-15 (a shortened Geriatric Depression Scale). Nine urban landscape indices (including four indices on green and blue spaces and five on building configurations) were applied as independent variables at the neighborhood level. Five circular landscapes with different radii (from 50 to 250 m) that took each neighborhood of interviewees as the center were created to calculated the indices. Hierarchical linear models were estimated to identify the links between urban landscape characteristics and mental health status, controlling for other confounding effects. The results showed that the characteristics of natural landscapes were negatively associated with the psychological disorders of participants within certain distances (100 m and 150 m), while building configurations were positively correlated with the depression in the elderly. The floor area ratio and average building height showed statistically significant and positive correlations with the GDS-15 score.

"Access to green space, physical activity and mental health: a twin study","Cohen-Cline, H; Turkheimer, E; Duncan, GE","Background Increasing global urbanisation has resulted in a greater proportion of the world's population becoming exposed to risk factors unique to urban areas, and understanding these effects on public health is essential. The aim of this study was to examine the association between access to green space and mental health among adult twin pairs.Methods We used a multilevel random intercept model of same-sex twin pairs (4338 individuals) from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry to analyse the association between access to green space, as measured by the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and self-reported depression, stress, and anxiety. The main parameter of interest was the within-pair effect for identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins because it was not subject to confounding by genetic or shared childhood environment factors. Models were adjusted for income, physical activity, neighbourhood deprivation and population density.Results When treating twins as individuals and not as members of a twin pair, green space was significantly inversely associated with each mental health outcome. The association with depression remained significant in the within-pair MZ univariate and adjusted models; however, there was no within-pair MZ effect for stress or anxiety among the models adjusted for income and physical activity.Conclusions These results suggest that greater access to green space is associated with less depression, but provide less evidence for effects on stress or anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms linking neighbourhood characteristics to mental health has important public health implications. Future studies should combine twin designs and longitudinal data to strengthen causal inference.",2015,,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,69,6,523-529,WOS:000354225800004,10.1136/jech-2014-204667,,#540,Cohen-Cline 2015,
Urban greenspace is associated with reduced psychological stress among adolescents: A Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA) analysis of activity space,"Mennis, J; Mason, M; Ambrus, A","This study investigates the momentary association between urban greenspace, captured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery, and psychological stress, captured using Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA), in the activity spaces of a sample of primarily African American adolescents residing in Richmond, Virginia. We employ generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the effect of exposure to urban greenspace on stress and test for moderation by sex, emotional dysregulation, season, neighborhood disadvantage, and whether the observation occurs at home or elsewhere. Results indicate that urban greenspace is associated with lower stress when subjects are away from home, which we speculate is due to the properties of stress reduction and attention restoration associated with exposure to natural areas, and to the primacy of other family dynamics mechanisms of stress within the home. Subjects may also seek out urban greenspaces at times of lower stress or explicitly for purposes of stress reduction. The greenspace-stress association away from home did not differ by sex, emotional dysregulation, neighborhood disadvantage, or season, the latter of which suggests that the observed greenspace-stress relationship is associated with being in a natural environment rather than strictly exposure to abundant green vegetation. Given the association of urban greenspace with lower stress found here and in other studies, future research should address the mediated pathways between greenspace, stress, and stress-related negative health outcomes for different population subgroups as a means toward understanding and addressing health disparities.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,174,,9-Jan,WOS:000430756400001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.02.008,,#541,Mennis 2018,
"Natural environments and suicide mortality in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional, ecological study","Helbich, M; de Beurs, D; Kwan, MP; O'Connor, RC; Groenewegen, PP","Background Natural outdoor environments, such as green spaces (ie, grass, forests, or parks), blue spaces (ie, visible bodies of fresh or salt water), and coastal proximity, have been increasingly shown to promote mental health. However, little is known about how and the extent to which these natural environments are associated with suicide mortality. Our aim was to investigate whether the availability of green space and blue space within people's living environments and living next to the coast are protective against suicide mortality.Methods In this cross-sectional, ecological study, we analysed officially confirmed deaths by suicide between 2005 and 2014 per municipality in the Netherlands. We calculated indexes to measure the proportion of green space and blue space per municipality and the coastal proximity of each municipality using a geographical information system. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regressions to assess associations between suicide risk, green space, blue space, and coastal proximity, adjusted for risk and protective factors.Findings Municipalities with a large proportion of green space (relative risk 0.879, 95% credibility interval 0.779-0.991) or a moderate proportion of green space (0.919, 0.846-0.998) showed a reduced suicide risk compared with municipalities with less green space. Green space did not differ according to urbanicity in relation to suicide. Neither blue space nor coastal proximity was associated with suicide risk. The geographical variation in the residual relative suicide risk was substantial and the south of the Netherlands was at high risk.Interpretation Our findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments, particularly to greenery, might have a role in reducing suicide mortality. If confirmed by future studies on an individual level, the consideration of environmental exposures might enrich suicide prevention programmes. Copyright (c) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Subtypes of park use and self-reported psychological benefits among older adults: A multilevel latent class analysis approach,"Li, DY; Zhai, YJ; Xiao, YY; Newman, G; Wang, D","Healthy aging is a global health priority. Urban parks and green space have been demonstrated to provide mental health benefits to older adults. Despite growing interest in prescribing nature and park visits by physicians, we do not know what type of park visit is most effective for the psychological benefits. This lack of knowledge prevents planners and designers from making informed decisions to promote mental health. We collected field data from 200 older visitors from 15 different parks in Shanghai, China. The participants completed pre-visit and post-visit surveys, wearing a GPS and a pedometer while visiting the park. A multilevel latent class analysis (LCA) yielded a three-class structure of park use patterns: the active park lingerer, the active walker, and the passive scanner. Paired-sample t-test and ANCOVA tests showed that affective states (i.e., anxiety, depression, relaxation, contention) were enhanced after park visits for all subtypes. However, the active park lingerer displayed significantly higher levels of relaxation and contention, compared to the active walker and the passive scanner.

"Older people, the natural environment and common mental disorders: cross-sectional results from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study","MRC CFAS; Wu, YT; Prina, AM; Jones, A; Matthews, FE; Brayne, C","Objectives: To explore the hypothesis that higher exposure to natural environments in local areas is associated with a lower odds of depression and anxiety in later life.Design: A cross-sectional study based on the year-10 interview of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS), a population-based study of ageing in the UK. Postcodes of the CFAS participants were mapped onto small geographic units, lower-layer super output areas (LSOAs) and linked to environmental data from government databases. The natural environment was characterised as the percentage of green space and private gardens in each LSOA based on the UK Generalised Land Use 2001 Dataset.Participants: 2424 people aged 74 and over in the CFAS year-10 follow-up interview (2001) from 4 English centres (Cambridgeshire, Nottingham, Newcastle and Oxford).Main outcome measures: Depression and anxiety; clinical and subthreshold cases were identified using the Geriatric Mental State Examination (GMS) package and its associated diagnostic algorithm: the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy.Results: Compared with the lowest quartile, living in the highest quartile of neighbourhood natural environment provision was associated with a reduced odds of subthreshold depression (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95), anxiety symptoms (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83) and their co-occurrence (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.84) after adjusting for individual-level factors. Controlling for area deprivation attenuated the strength of associations for subthreshold depression by 20% but not for anxiety symptoms or for co-occurrence of the conditions.Conclusions: A high exposure to natural environments (green space and gardens) in communities was associated with fewer mental disorders among older people.

This study aimed to provide an evaluation of a smartphone app-based wellbeing intervention. In a randomised controlled trial study design, the app prompted 582 adults, including a subgroup of adults classified by baseline scores on the Recovering Quality of Life scale as having a common mental health problem (n = 148), to notice the good things about urban nature (intervention condition) or built spaces (active control). There were statistically significant and sustained improvements in wellbeing at one-month follow-up. Importantly, in the noticing urban nature condition, compared to a built space control, improvements in quality of life reached statistical significance for all adults and clinical significance for those classified as having a mental health difficulty. This improvement in wellbeing was partly explained by significant increases in nature connectedness and positive affect. This study provides the first controlled experimental evidence that noticing the good things about urban nature has strong clinical potential as a wellbeing intervention and social prescription.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,18,,WOS:000489178500147,10.3390/ijerph16183373,,#570,McEwan 2019,
Quantity or quality? Exploring the association between public open space and mental health in urban China,"Zhu, W; Wang, JJ; Qin, B","Public open space (POS) is a component of the urban built environment that is considered crucial for people's mental health. Most studies, however, have focused on the quantity of POS, and those investigating the association between POS quality and mental health are limited. Through a 2018 survey of 590 residents and 160 POSs in Zhuhai, this study explored the association between both the quantity and quality attributes of POS and residents' mental health in urban China. We employed an audit tool (POST) to measure POS quality and decomposed it into four attributes: activity, environmental quality, amenities, and safety. The statistical analyses suggest that POS quality is important for positive mental wellbeing, while, among the four attributes, activity and environment attributes are significantly associated with better mental health. The findings not only shed light on the potential mechanism of POS' impact on mental health, but also help urban planners and policymakers develop an evidence-based approach to healthy cities.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,213,,,WOS:000654110100008,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104128,,#572,Zhu 2021,
"Effects of the School-Based Integrated Health Promotion Program With Hydroponic Planting on Green Space Use and Satisfaction, Dietary Habits, and Mental Health in Early Adolescent Students: A Feasibility Quasi-Experiment","Kwok, SWH; Wu, CST; Tong, HT; Ho, CN; Leung, KL; Leung, YCP; Lui, KC; Wong, CKC","Background: School-based green space activities have been found to be beneficial to the physical activity level and lifestyle habits of adolescent students. However, their effects on green space use and satisfaction, mental health, and dietary behaviors required further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of school-based hydroponic planting integrated with health promotion activities in improving green space use, competence and satisfaction, healthy lifestyle, mental health, and health-related quality of life (QoL) among early adolescent students in secondary schools.Methods: This study adopted a three-group comparison design (one control and two intervention groups). Secondary school students (N = 553) of grades 7-9 participated in either (1) hydroponic planting (two times per week for 8 months) integrated with health promotion activities; (2) only health promotion activities (one time per week for 6 weeks); or (3) control group. Outcomes assessed by questionnaire included green space use and satisfaction, life happiness, lifestyle, depressive symptoms, and health-related QoL.Results: After adjusting for sex and school grade, the scores in ""green space distance and use"" and ""green space activity and competence"" were significantly better in the intervention groups than in the control group. Hydroponic planting integrated with health promotion activities was also associated with better scores in dietary habits and resistance to substance use. Intervention groups had a higher score in ""Green space sense and satisfaction"" and life happiness when compared with the control group.Conclusions: Our study shows that the school-based hydroponic planting integrated with health promotion activities were feasible and, to a certain extent, useful to improve green space use and competence, dietary habits, and resistance to substance use among early adolescent students in secondary schools in urban areas.

"Physical and Mental Health Impacts of Household Gardens in an Urban Slum in Lima, Peru","Korn, A; Bolton, SM; Spencer, B; Alarcon, JA; Andrews, L; Voss, JG","Rural poverty and lack of access to education has led to urban migration and fed the constant growth of urban slums in Lima, Peru. Inhabitants of these informal settlements lack land rights and access to a public water supply, resulting in poor sanitation, an inability to grow food, and suboptimal health outcomes. A repeated measures longitudinal pilot study utilizing participatory design methods was conducted in Lima between September 2013 and September 2014 to determine the feasibility of implementing household gardens and the subsequent impact of increased green space on well-being. Anthropometric data and a composite of five validated mental health surveys were collected at the baseline, 6-months, and 12-months after garden construction. Significant increases from the baseline in all domains of quality of life, including: physical (p < 0.01), psychological (p = 0.05), social (p = 0.02), environmental (p = 0.02), and overall social capital (p < 0.01) were identified 12 months after garden construction. Life-threatening experiences decreased significantly compared to the baseline (p = 0.02). There were no significant changes in parent or partner empathy (p = 0.21), BMI (p = 0.95), waist circumference (p = 0.18), or blood pressure (p = 0.66) at 6 or 12 months.

Emotional Well-Being in Urban Wilderness: Assessing States of Calmness and Alertness in Informal Green Spaces (IGSs) with Muse-Portable EEG Headband,"Herman, K; Ciechanowski, L; Przegalinska, A","In this experiment, we operated within the novel research area of Informal Green Spaces (often called green wastelands), exploring emotional well-being with the employment of portable electroencephalography (EEG) devices. The apparatus (commercial EEG Muse headband) provided an opportunity to analyze states of calmness and alertness in n = 20 participants as they visited selected Informal Green Spaces in Warsaw, Poland. The article aims to test the hypothesis that passive recreation in Informal Green Spaces (IGSs) has a positive impact on emotional well-being and that there is a connection between the intensity of states of calmness and alertness and 1. the type of green space (IGS/GS), 2. the type of scenery and 3. the type of IGS. The preliminary experiment showed that there might be no substantial distinction in the users' levels of emotional states when considering existing typologies. On the other hand, data-driven analysis suggests that there might be a connection between the state of alertness and some characteristics of specific areas. After carrying out the multivariate analyses of variance in the repeated measurement scheme and finding significant differences between oscillations in different areas, we conclude that there might be three possible sources of lower alertness and increased calmness in some areas. These are 1. the presence of ""desirable"" human intervention such as paths and urban furniture, 2. a lack of ""undesirable"" users and signs of their presence and 3. the presence of other ""desirable"" users.",2021,,SUSTAINABILITY,13,4,,WOS:000624823200001,10.3390/su13042212,,#591,Herman 2021,
More green space is related to less antidepressant prescription rates in the Netherlands: A Bayesian geoadditive quantile regression approach,"Helbich, M; Klein, N; Roberts, H; Hagedoorn, P; Groenewegen, PP","Background: Exposure to green space seems to be beneficial for self-reported mental health. In this study we used an objective health indicator, namely antidepressant prescription rates. Current studies rely exclusively upon mean regression models assuming linear associations. It is, however, plausible that the presence of green space is non-linearly related with different quantiles of the outcome antidepressant prescription rates. These restrictions may contribute to inconsistent findings.Objective: Our aim was: a) to assess antidepressant prescription rates in relation to green space, and b) to analyze how the relationship varies non-linearly across different quantiles of antidepressant prescription rates.Methods: We used cross-sectional data for the year 2014 at a municipality level in the Netherlands. Ecological Bayesian geoadditive quantile regressions were fitted for the 15%, 50%, and 85% quantiles to estimate green space-prescription rate correlations, controlling for physical activity levels, socio-demographics, urbanicity, etc.Results: The results suggested that green space was overall inversely and non-linearly associated with antidepressant prescription rates. More important, the associations differed across the quantiles, although the variation was modest. Significant non-linearities were apparent: The associations were slightly positive in the lower quantile and strongly negative in the upper one.Conclusion: Our findings imply that an increased availability of green space within a municipality may contribute to a reduction in the number of antidepressant prescriptions dispensed. Green space is thus a central health and community asset, whilst a minimum level of 28% needs to be established for health gains. The highest effectiveness occurred at a municipality surface percentage higher than 79%. This inverse dose-dependent relation has important implications for setting future community-level health and planning policies.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,166,,290-297,WOS:000445318200031,10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.010,,#607,Helbich 2018,
"Verification of Psychophysiological Effects of Satoyama Activities on Older Adult Volunteers and Young People in Post-COVID-19 Society: A Case Study of Matsudo City, Japan","Xiang, QY; Yuan, ZW; Furuya, K; Kagawa, T","Many scholars have focused on Satoyama, which is characterized by mountains or villages away from the urban spaces. Our objective is to verify its psychophysiological effects on people performing usual Satoyama activities in ignored, small urban green spaces to help people find ways to stay healthy in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) society. In this study, 12 older adult volunteers from the ""Forest around the Mountains"" Nonprofit Organization and 12 young people from the university were invited as study subjects. They were asked to observe nature for 10 min and work for 30 min in the small green space ""Forest around the Mountains"". The Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventor (STAI) were used as psychological scales to detect their psychological restoration and blood pressure before and after the Satoyama activity. Their heart rate during the activity was used as the physiological indicator. The study showed that, as Satoyama volunteers, the older adults group had significant restorative psychophysiological effects during this experiment compared to the younger group; their systolic and diastolic blood pressure dropped significantly after Satoyama activities, On the other hand, the young group have been in the normotensive range before or after Satoyama activities The psychological indicators such as Anger-hostility, Confusion-bewilderment, and Tension-anxiety were significantly lower in the younger group but were still significantly higher than the indicators of the older adults. In general, this study found that Satoyama activities benefited young and older participants, especially older adults with high blood pressure.

The Application of Wearable Technology to Quantify Health and Wellbeing Co-benefits From Urban Wetlands,"Reeves, JP; Knight, AT; Strong, EA; Heng, V; Neale, C; Cromie, R; Vercammen, A","Improved nature provision in urban environments offers great potential for achieving both biodiversity conservation and public health objectives. Yet there are few experimental studies that address links between specific natural environments and physiological and/or psychological changes that could contribute to the health and wellbeing co-benefits of urban nature. In addition, relative to green space, the salutogenic impact of aquatic environments are understudied. Here, we present a feasibility study examining the use of low-cost wearable technology to quantify the psychophysiological effects of short-term exposure to urban wetlands. The study took place at the WWT London Wetland Centre, which is characterized by its contrasting biodiverse wetland habitat and surrounding urban setting. Thirty-six healthy participants experienced counterbalanced exposures to an indoor space, a wetland, an urban site. We continuously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data and real-time physiological stress responses; with additional monitoring of post-exposure self-reported mood states. We found a significant effect of site on mean resting heart rate (HR), with increased HR in the urban setting, although this was only observed in participants with pre-existing high stress. We found no significant differences in other measures of physiological stress responses (heart rate variability and electrodermal activity). The EEG data showed modulation of high beta band activity only in the wetland setting, potentially related to changes in attention. However, the EEG findings were confounded by low quality signals and artifacts caused by movement and environmental interference. Assessments of self-reported mood states demonstrated an increase in positive feelings in the wetland setting. A pronounced decrease in negative feelings in the wetland setting was observed in stressed individuals only. Our results suggest that pre-existing stress levels may be an important modulator of the salutogenic effect of blue-green space. We provide partial support for the hypothesis that exposure to blue-green space promotes stress recovery and for the use of low-cost psychophysiological measurements to quantify the potential stress-reducing effects of blue-green space exposure in urban dwellers. Further technological refinement is required for this approach to become a viable tool to support evidence-based decision-making for public health and green/blue space provision.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10,,,WOS:000480577200002,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01840,,#616,Reeves 2019,
Use of Urban Residential Community Parks for Stress Management During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in China,"Kang, N; Bell, S; Thompson, CW; Zheng, MM; Xu, ZW; Sun, ZW","During the pandemic lockdown period, residents had to stay at home and increased stress and other mental health problems have been associated with the lockdown period. Since most public parks were closed, community parks within gated residential areas became the most important green space in Chinese cities, and the use of such space might help to reduce the residents' stress levels. This study aimed to investigate to what extent urban residents in China used community parks, engaged in outdoor activity during the lockdown period (23 January-8 April 2020) and if the use of such spaces helped to reduce their stress levels. An online questionnaire survey (n = 1342) was carried out from 23 March to 23 April 2020. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to analyse the association between community park use, outdoor activity, willingness to engage in outdoor activity, and stress level. All results have been further analysed by two-sampled t-test to explore the difference between young and old age groups. We found that the overall self-reported stress level of the respondents was relatively moderate during the lockdown period. Respondents had generally reduced their use of community parks and engagement in outdoor activity. There was no significant association between stress level and the use of community parks or the engagement in outdoor activities. However, we found that older people showed much lower stress levels, used community parks more frequently, and engaged in more outdoor activities than younger adults. The findings suggest that outdoor activities and spatial characteristics in urban China differ from Western studies and advance the need to integrate the stress management role of community parks with urban green space policy to optimise the use of community parks blended in with everyday life, particularly during the lockdown period.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,13,,,WOS:000783690700001,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.816417,,#617,Kang 2022,
Coastal proximity and mental health among urban adults in England: The moderating effect of household income,"Garrett, JK; Clitherow, TJ; White, MP; Wheeler, BW; Fleming, LE","After adjusting for covariates, self-reported general health in England is higher among populations living closer to the coast, and the association is strongest amongst more deprived groups.

Impact of dynamic greenspace exposure on symptomatology in individuals with schizophrenia,"Henson, P; Pearson, JF; Keshavan, M; Torous, J","There are currently many tools available for capturing and defining the context of one's environment. Digital phenotyping, the use of technology and sensors to capture moment-to-moment behavior, has shown potential in quantifying the lived experience of mental illness and in the identification of individualized targets related to recovery. Environmental data suggests that greenspace may have a restorative capacity on mental health. In this paper, we explore the relationship of greenspace derived from geolocation with self-reported symptomatology from individuals with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls. Individuals with schizophrenia had less exposure to greenspace than controls, but their exposure demonstrated a dosage effect: high greenspace environments were associated with lower symptoms for anxiety (Cohen's d = -0.70), depression (d = -0.97), and psychosis (d = -0.94), whereas effect sizes for healthy controls were all negligible or small (d < 0.38). The notion that greenspace may have a more pronounced effect on individuals with mental illness presents both potential areas for recovery as well as implications for health care policy, especially in cities with a broad range of greenspace environments.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,9,,WOS:000571063300101,10.1371/journal.pone.0238498,,#624,Henson 2020,
Association of environmental and socioeconomic indicators with serious mental illness diagnoses identified from general practitioner practice data in England: A spatial Bayesian modelling study,"Cruz, J; Li, GQ; Aragon, MJ; Coventry, PA; Jacobs, R; Prady, SL; White, PCL","BackgroundThe evidence is sparse regarding the associations between serious mental illnesses (SMIs) prevalence and environmental factors in adulthood as well as the geographic distribution and variability of these associations. In this study, we evaluated the association between availability and proximity of green and blue space with SMI prevalence in England as a whole and in its major conurbations (Greater London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle).Methods and findingsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of routinely collected adult population (>= 18 years) data at General Practitioner Practice (GPP) level. We used data from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) on the prevalence of a diagnosis of SMI (schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses, and other patients on lithium therapy) at the level of GPP over the financial year April 2014 to March 2018. The number of GPPs included ranged between 7,492 (April 2017 to March 2018) to 7,997 (April 2014 to March 2015) and the number of patients ranged from 56,413,719 (April 2014 to March 2015) to 58,270,354 (April 2017 to March 2018). Data at GPP level were converted to the geographic hierarchy unit Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level for analysis. LSOAs are a geographic unit for reporting small area statistics and have an average population of around 1,500 people. We employed a Bayesian spatial regression model to explore the association of SMI prevalence in England and its major conurbations (greater London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle) with environmental characteristics (green and blue space, flood risk areas, and air and noise pollution) and socioeconomic characteristics (age, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD)). We incorporated spatial random effects in our modelling to account for variation at multiple scales.Across England, the environmental characteristics associated with higher SMI prevalence at LSOA level were distance to public green space with a lake (prevalence ratio [95% credible interval]): 1.002 [1.001 to 1.003]), annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (1.014 [1.01 to 1.019]), and closeness to roads with noise levels above 75 dB (0.993 [0.992 to 0.995]). Higher SMI prevalence was also associated with a higher percentage of people above 24 years old (1.002 [1.002 to 1.003]), a higher percentage of ethnic minorities (1.002 [1.001 to 1.002]), and more deprived areas.Mean SMI prevalence at LSOA level in major conurbations mirrored the national associations with a few exceptions. In Birmingham, higher average SMI prevalence at LSOA level was positively associated with proximity to an urban green space with a lake (0.992 [0.99 to 0.998]). In Liverpool and Manchester, lower SMI prevalence was positively associated with road traffic noise >= 75 dB (1.012 [1.003 to 1.022]). In Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, there was a positive association of SMI prevalence with distance to flood zone 3 (land within flood zone 3 has >= 1% chance of flooding annually from rivers or >= 0.5% chance of flooding annually from the sea, when flood defences are ignored): Birmingham: 1.012 [1.000 to 1.023]; Liverpool and Manchester: 1.016 [1.006 to 1.026]. In contrast, in Leeds, there was a negative association between SMI prevalence and distance to flood zone 3 (0.959 [0.944 to 0.975]). A limitation of this study was because we used a cross-sectional approach, we are unable to make causal inferences about our findings or investigate the temporal relationship between outcome and risk factors. Another limitation was that individuals who are exclusively treated under specialist mental health care and not seen in primary care at all were not included in this analysis.ConclusionsOur study provides further evidence on the significance of socioeconomic associations in patterns of SMI but emphasises the additional importance of considering environmental characteristics alongside socioeconomic variables in understanding these patterns. In this study, we did not observe a significant association between green space and SMI prevalence, but we did identify an apparent association between green spaces with a lake and SMI prevalence. Deprivation, higher concentrations of air pollution, and higher proportion of ethnic minorities were associated with higher SMI prevalence, supporting a social-ecological approach to public health prevention. It also provides evidence of the significance of spatial analysis in revealing the importance of place and context in influencing area-based patterns of SMI.",2022,,PLOS MEDICINE,19,6,,WOS:000892011400001,10.1371/journal.pmed.1004043,,#625,Cruz 2022,
Hemodynamic Response to Three Types of Urban Spaces before and after Lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Olszewska-Guizzo, A; Mukoyama, A; Naganawa, S; Dan, I; Husain, SF; Ho, CS; Ho, R","(1) Background: Prolonged lockdowns with stay-at-home orders have been introduced in many countries since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have caused a drastic change in the everyday lives of people living in urbanized areas, and are considered to contribute to a modified perception of the public space. As research related to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and well-being emerges, the associated longitudinal changes of brain hemodynamics in healthy adults remain largely unknown. (2) Methods: this study examined the hemodynamic activation patterns of the prefrontal and occipital cortices of 12 participants (5 male, M-age = 47.80, SDage = 17.79, range 25 to 74, and 7 female, M-age = 39.00, SDage = 18.18, range 21 to 65) passively viewing videos from three urban sites in Singapore (Urban Park, Neighborhood Landscape and City Center) at two different time points-T1, before the COVID-19 pandemic and T2, soon after the lockdown was over. (3) Results: We observed a significant and marginally significant decrease in average oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) over time for each of the visual conditions. For both green spaces (Urban Park and Neighborhood Landscape), the decrease was in the visual cortex, while for the City Center with no green elements, the marginal decrease was observed in the visual cortex and the frontal eye fields. (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that the COVID-19-related lockdown experienced by urban inhabitants may have contributed to decreased brain hemodynamics, which are further related to a heightened risk of mental health disorders, such as depression or a decline in cognitive functions. Moreover, the busy City Center scenes induced a hemodynamic pattern associated with stress and anxiety, while urban green spaces did not cause such an effect. Urban green scenes can be an important factor to offset the negative neuropsychological impact of busy urban environments post-pandemic.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,11,,WOS:000659928900001,10.3390/ijerph18116118,,#635,Olszewska-Guizzo 2021,
"Elderly visitors of an urban park, health anxiety and individual awareness of nature experiences","Dzhambov, AM; Dimitrova, DD","There is increasing evidence of a positive relation between green spaces in people's living environment and self-reported indicators of physical and mental health. However, to this moment health anxiety has not been contextualized in the light of the restorative and anxiolytic experiences of urban nature nor has it been studied in reference to the awareness of nature experiences. We aimed to determine whether ""awareness of nature experiences"" was a significant modifier of the beneficial effects of interaction of older citizens with urban green spaces. This construct represents the purposeful and conscious interaction with nature, a specific behaviour pre-formed as a cognitive representation of the ""self' in a natural context, providing an internal replica of the previously experienced external natural world which guides people when they choose to visit an urban park. A cross-sectional interview study was conducted amongst 97 elderly visitors of ""Tzar Simeon Garden"" Park in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. After controlling for ""awareness of nature experiences"", hierarchical multiple regression model accounted for 94% of the variance in health anxiety. The independent variables ""appreciation of bird songs"", ""appreciation of vegetation"", ""weekly visits to the park"" and ""years of visiting the park"" remained significant, but their power decreased, and ""age"" became non-significant predictor. The overall predictive capacity of the model rose significantly after ""awareness of nature experiences"" was added. In conclusion, health anxiety among Bulgarian elderly adults is somewhat higher than in other similar populations but still does not exceed acceptable levels. The actual interaction and experiences of the park were predictors of health anxiety independent from confounding factors. Their power, however, was to some extent dependent on individual ""awareness of nature experiences"", which had unique contribution to the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

"Do Green Spaces Matter? The Associations Between Parenting Stress, Child Mental Health Problems And Green Spaces","Balseviciene, B; Sinkariova, L; Andrusaityte, S","Parenting stress is among the contextual factors that have been subject to vigorous research in terms of its effect on parenting behaviors and on child development. There is convincing evidence linking parenting stress related to reports of child behavioral and emotional problems, adjustment difficulties, and internalizing or externalizing problems (Abidin, 1995; Berllinger, 1994; Haskett et al., 2006; Bayer et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2006; Ashfort et al., 2008; Crnic et al., 2005). On the other hand, green spaces are associated with better child mental health (Strife et al., 2009; Louv, 2005). The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between parenting stress, children mental health and green spaces. Methods. Data were obtained from Kaunas cohort study (Kaunas KANC, Lithuania). Distance to natural water pond and green spaces was based on spatial land cover data sets for Kaunas city which were obtained from the municipality and were processed using ArcGIS 10 software. 645 women filled in Simplified version of Parenting Stress index - short form (S - PSI/SF, Abidin, 1995; Yeh et al., 2001), Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire Lithuanian version (SDQ, Gintiliene et al., 2004). We used regression analysis to examine a model of these associations. Findings and Results. The linear regression analysis showed that parenting stress was significantly predicted by the distance to natural water pond, child mental health problems, and child physical health. The best model of associations was when all predictors were included. However, the distance to green spaces was not a significant predictor. Conclusions and recommendations. We conclude that not only child mental health problems or physical health matter in predicting parenting stress, but the distance to natural water pond such as river is important factor too. Our recommendation is in other research to take a deeper look in these associations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Neighbourhood greenspace quantity, quality and socioeconomic inequalities in mental health","Wang, RY; Feng, ZQ; Pearce, J","There is tentative evidence suggesting that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups may benefit more from access to neighbourhood greenspace and therefore could be a lever for narrowing socioeconomic inequalities ('equigenesis') in mental health, although studies are equivocal. One potential explanation for this inconsistency is differences in study designs, particularly how greenspace is measured. Most previous studies are from high income countries, and there has been no investigations into equigenic environments in China. Using survey data collected from 26 neighbourhoods in Guangzhou, China, this study examines whether local greenspaces may narrow socioeconomic inequalities in health (i.e. equigenesis) in the Chinese context. The study is the first to explore the contribution of greenspace in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in mental health in the Chinese context. It uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Street View Greenness (SVG) and self-reported neighbourhood greenness quality as estimates of residential greenness exposure Results show that SVG-quantity, SVG-quality and self-reported greenspace quality narrow the neighbourhood socioeconomic inequalities in mental health. Our findings demonstrate the importance of improving equity in local green infrastructure for promoting health equity through urban planning and design, including improving access to green spaces, and providing more street trees in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods.",2022,,CITIES,129,,,WOS:000819400000003,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103815,,#642,Wang 2022,
"Green space, air pollution, traffic noise and mental wellbeing throughout adolescence: Findings from the PIAMA study","Bloemsma, LD; Wijga, AH; Klompmaker, JO; Hoek, G; Janssen, NAH; Lebret, E; Brunekreef, B; Gehring, U","Background: Green space, air pollution and traffic noise exposure may be associated with mental health in adolescents. We assessed the associations of long-term exposure to residential green space, ambient air pollution and traffic noise with mental wellbeing from age 11 to 20 years. Methods: We included 3059 participants of the Dutch PIAMA birth cohort who completed the five-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) at ages 11, 14, 17 and/or 20 years. We estimated exposure to green space (the average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and percentages of green space in circular buffers of 300 m, 1000 m and 3000 m), ambient air pollution (particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 absorbance and the oxidative potential of PM2.5) and road traffic and railway noise (L-den) at the adolescents' home addresses at the times of completing the MHI-5. Associations with poor mental wellbeing (MHI-5 score <= 60) were assessed by generalized linear mixed models with a logit link, adjusting for covariates. Results: The odds of poor mental wellbeing at age 11 to 20 years decreased with increasing exposure to green space in a 3000 m buffer (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.78 [95% CI 0.68-0.88] per IQR increase in the average NDVI; adjusted OR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67-0.88] per IQR increase in the total percentage of green space). These associations persisted after adjustment for air pollution and road traffic noise. Relationships between mental wellbeing and green space in buffers of 300 m and 1000 m were less consistent. Higher air pollution exposure was associated with higher odds of poor mental wellbeing, but these associations were strongly attenuated after adjustment for green space in a buffer of 3000 m, traffic noise and degree of urbanization. Traffic noise was not related to mental wellbeing throughout adolescence. Conclusions: Residential exposure to green space may be associated with a better mental wellbeing in adolescents.",2022,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,163,,,WOS:000800102400002,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107197,,#650,Bloemsma 2022,
A cross-sectional analysis of green space prevalence and mental wellbeing in England,"Houlden, V; Weich, S; Jarvis, S","Background: With urbanisation increasing, it is important to understand how to design changing environments to promote mental wellbeing. Evidence suggests that local-area proportions of green space may be associated with happiness and life satisfaction; however, the available evidence on such associations with more broadly defined mental wellbeing in still very scarce. This study aimed to establish whether the amount of neighbourhood green space was associated with mental wellbeing.Methods: Data were drawn from Understanding Society, a national survey of 30,900 individuals across 11,096 Census Lower-Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England, over the period 2009-2010. Measures included the multidimensional Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS) and LSOA proportion of green space, which was derived from the General Land Use Database (GLUD), and were analysed using linear regression, while controlling for individual, household and area-level factors.Results: Those living in areas with greater proportions of green space had significantly higher mental wellbeing scores in unadjusted analyses (an expected increase of 0.17 points (95% CI 0.11, 0.23) in the SWEMWBS score for a standard deviation increase of green space). However, after adjustment for confounding by respondent sociodemographic characteristics and urban/rural location, the association was attenuated to the null (regression coefficient B = -0.01, 95% CI -0.08, 0.05, p = 0.712).Conclusions: While the green space in an individual's local area has been shown through other research to be related to aspects of mental health such as happiness and life satisfaction, the association with multidimensional mental wellbeing is much less clear from our results. While we did not find a statistically significant association between the amount of green space in residents' local areas and mental wellbeing, further research is needed to understand whether other features of green space, such as accessibility, aesthetics or use, are important for mental wellbeing.",2017,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,17,,,WOS:000401866500003,10.1186/s12889-017-4401-x,,#651,Houlden 2017,
Urban green space in India: Perception of cultural ecosystem services and psychology of situatedness and connectedness,"Sen, S; Guchhait, SK","Nature or more specifically ecosystem provides a range of services regarding economic benefits, improving air quality as well as enhancing physical, social well-being and also mental health. Today, with the increasing complexity in urban life, most of the urbanites are experiencing significantly lower levels of daily contact with nature than the parent generation. As a matter of fact, people are suffocating in their daily life and in a state of mental muddled for which they frequently urge for nature connectedness through outing to get read of this hectic urban life. Hence, for the present study, the possible ways of exposure to nature has been considered within the city and its impact on social life and psychological behaviour. In a rapidly transforming city space and city life, the incorporation of nature within the urban areas largely depends on to what extent people are willing to build up and enjoy green space. To portray the underlying canvas, presence of nature and its cognitive reflection in a city two kinds of situational environment are taken into consideration: Study site-1:very close to nature that normally precludes possibility of physical and psychological attachment towards nature while the other i.e., Study site-2: a busy urban environment away from nature where people show more interest for beautification of the surroundings as they are accustomed with materialistic life rather than natural set up. Therefore, quantitative assessment is ascribed through factorial ecology in understanding the importance of green space for cultural ecosystem services. The analysis is further accentuated to find out the behavioural response of two different sites through weighted measures and subsequent regression analysis as well as narrative analysis in analysing human psychology in the context of fondness of nature or Biophilia.",2021,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,123,,,WOS:000615921500004,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107338,,#658,Sen 2021,
Tree cover shows an inverse relationship with depressive symptoms in elderly residents living in US nursing homes,"Browning, MHEM; Lee, K; Wolf, KL","People who live near more greenspace report less anxiety and depression. Do these findings hold for elderly populations living in care facilities, such as nursing homes? The answer to this question has not been directly examined. Studies on the relationship between greenspace and mental health in this population have focused on nature-based therapy programs rather than on greenspace coverage. Research on outdoor greenspace coverage is important for facility design. Facilities should know whether to prioritize greening investments in indoor atriums where programming can be provided year-round or in outdoor greenspace, which can also promote health by providing restorative views and reducing harmful exposures (e.g., noise and air pollution). To investigate whether nursing homes residents benefit from outdoor greenspace cover, we examined the relationship between tree canopy cover around 9186 U.S. nursing homes and the percentage of residents suffering from depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms data were obtained from the 2011 Minimum Data Set, and canopy data were obtained from the 2011 National Land Cover Database. Because facilities with more resources and higher qualifies of care might also have more trees, we gathered 2011 data on occupancy rates, staffing ratios, age, sex, percent Medicaid eligibility, care needs, for-profit status, presence of special care units from the Long Term Care Focus dataset as well as air quality and population density and used these potential covariates in adjusted generalized linear mixed models and spatial lag models. We observed an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and tree cover surrounding facilities. Associations did not vary by aggregated racial or socioeconomic characteristics of residents but did became weaker at greater distances from facilities. These findings provide hypotheses for future testing regarding whether nursing homes should incorporate outdoor greening in addition to nature-based therapy programs for residents' mental health.",2019,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,41,,23-32,WOS:000468191300004,10.1016/j.ufug.2019.03.002,,#661,Browning 2019,
A life course approach to understanding associations between natural environments and mental well-being for the Danish blood donor cohort,"Engemann, K; Svenning, JC; Arge, L; Brandt, J; Bruun, MT; Didriksen, M; Erikstrup, C; Geels, C; Hertel, O; Horsdal, HT; Kaspersen, KA; Mikkelsen, S; Mortensen, PB; Nielsen, KR; Ostrowski, SR; Pedersen, OB; Tsirogiannis, C; Sabel, CE; Sigsgaard, T; Ullum, H; Pedersen, CB","Natural environments have been associated with mental health benefits, but globally access to these benefits is threatened by urban development and densification. However, it remains unclear how natural environments relate to mental health and how consistent the association is across populations. Here we use a life-course approach with a population consisting of 66 194 individuals from the Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS) to investigate the association between green and blue space (e.g. parks and lakes) and self-evaluated mental well-being. Green and blue space was identified from remotely-sensed images from the Landsat program, while mental well-being was based on the mental component score (MCS) calculated using the 12-item short form health survey. We use multivariate linear regression models and logistic regression models to quantify the as-sociations. We adjust for additional environmental (urbanization, and air pollution) and lifestyle factors (smoking, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and physical activity) and specifically evaluate the role of physical activity and air pollution as possible mediating factors. We found a positive association between the MCS and current and childhood green space, and a non-significant association for current and childhood blue space. Adjusting for environmental and the other factors attenuated the effect sizes indicating that a broad range of factors determine mental well-being. Physical activity and air pollution were both associated with the MCS as possible mediators of green space associations. In addition, the odds for successfully completing tasks', seeing others, and feeling less downhearted increased with higher levels of green space, and the odds of feeling calm increased with higher levels of blue space. In conclusion, we found support for an association between green and, to less degree, blue space and mental well-being throughout different life stages. In addition, we found a positive association with individual indicators of mental well-being such as being productive, feeling less downhearted and calmer, and being social. The healthy blood donor effect and the bias towards urban residency may explain why we found smaller effect sizes between green and blue space and mental well-being for this generally healthy and resourceful cohort compared to previous studies.",2021,,HEALTH & PLACE,72,,,WOS:000703052800002,10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102678,,#670,Engemann 2021,
Does the Health Impact of Exposure to Neighbourhood Green Space Differ between Population Groups? An Explorative Study in Four European Cities,"Ruijsbroek, A; Droomers, M; Kruize, H; Van Kempen, E; Gidlow, CJ; Hurst, G; Andrusaityte, S; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ; Maas, J; Hardyns, W; Stronks, K; Groenewegen, PP","It has been suggested that certain residents, such as those with a low socioeconomic status, the elderly, and women, may benefit more from the presence of neighbourhood green space than others. We tested this hypothesis for age, gender, educational level, and employment status in four European cities. Data were collected in Barcelona (Spain; n = 1002), Kaunas (Lithuania; n = 989), Doetinchem (The Netherlands; n = 847), and Stoke-on-Trent (UK; n = 933) as part of the EU-funded PHENOTYPE project. Surveys were used to measure mental and general health, individual characteristics, and perceived neighbourhood green space. Additionally, we used audit data about neighbourhood green space. In Barcelona, there were positive associations between neighbourhood green space and general health among low-educated residents. In the other cities and for the other population groups, there was little evidence that the association between health and neighbourhood green space differed between population groups. Overall, our study does not support the assumption that the elderly, women, and residents who are not employed full-time benefit more from neighbourhood green space than others. Only in the highly urbanised city of Barcelona did the low-educated group benefit from neighbourhood green spaces.

Yet, there is little research investigating the extent to which, and for whom, nature experiences deliver such benefits outside Europe, North America, and Australia. Here, we assessed the relationships between nature dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) and three mental wellbeing (depression, stress, and anxiety) and two physical health (high blood pressure, diabetes) outcomes in Singapore, an intensely urbanised tropical city. Our analyses accounted for individual factors, including socio-economic status, nature connection (nature relatedness), and whether people with poor health are prevented by their condition from visiting green spaces. Our results show that the association between nature dose (specifically duration) and mental wellbeing is moderated by a nature connection. Specifically, people with a stronger nature connection were less likely to be depressed, stressed, and anxious, regardless of the duration of their nature dose. For those with a weaker connection to nature, spending longer in nature was associated with being more depressed, stressed, and anxious. We did not find a relationship between nature dose and high blood pressure or diabetes.

Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-12v2, which measures residents' self-reported mental and physical health. Results showed a significant association between use frequency and perceived walking distance to blue space. Blue space use was a better indicator of health outcomes than perceived walking distance.

Nature's Role in Supporting Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Geospatial and Socioecological Study,"Robinson, JM; Brindley, P; Cameron, R; MacCarthy, D; Jorgensen, A","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes to human lifestyles across the world. The virus and associated social restriction measures have been linked to an increase in mental health conditions. A considerable body of evidence shows that spending time in and engaging with nature can improve human health and wellbeing. Our study explores nature's role in supporting health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created web-based questionnaires with validated health instruments and conducted spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS). We collected data (n = 1184) on people's patterns of nature exposure, associated health and wellbeing responses, and potential socioecological drivers such as relative deprivation, access to greenspaces, and land-cover greenness. The majority of responses came from England, UK (n = 993). We applied a range of statistical analyses including bootstrap-resampled correlations and binomial regression models, adjusting for several potential confounding factors. We found that respondents significantly changed their patterns of visiting nature as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People spent more time in nature and visited nature more often during the pandemic. People generally visited nature for a health and wellbeing benefit and felt that nature helped them cope during the pandemic. Greater land-cover greenness within a 250 m radius around a respondent's postcode was important in predicting higher levels of mental wellbeing.

Increased urban greenness associated with improved mental health among middle-aged and older adults of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA),"Cottagiri, SA; Villeneuve, PJ; Raina, P; Griffith, LE; Rainham, D; Dales, R; Peters, CE; Ross, NA; Crouse, DL","Objectives: Some studies suggest that residential surrounding greenness is associated with improved mental health. Few of these studies have focussed on middle-aged and older adults, explored the modifying effects of social determinants of health, or accounted for the extent to which individuals interact with their neighbourhood environments.Methods: We analysed cross-sectional data collected from 26,811 urban participants of the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging who were between 45 and 86 years of age. Participants provided details on socioeconomic characteristics, health behaviours, and their frequency of neighbourhood interactions. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a measure of greenness, was assigned to participants' residential addresses at a buffer distance of 500 m. Four self-reported measures of mental health were considered: The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10; short scale), past diagnosis of clinical depression, perceptions of mental health, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Regression models were used to describe associations between greenness and these outcomes, and spline models were fit to characterize the exposure-response function between greenness and CES-D-10 scores. Stratified analyses evaluated whether associations varied by sociodemographic status.Results: In adjusted models, we observed a 5% (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.90, 0.99) reduced odds of depressive symptoms in relation to an interquartile range increase of NDVI (0.06) within a 500 m buffer of the participant's residence. Similarly, we found an inverse association with a self-reported clinical diagnosis of depression (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.92-1.01). Increases in surrounding greenness were associated with improved perceptions of mental health, and the SWLS. Our spline analyses found that beneficial effects between greenness and the CES-D-10 were strongest among those of lower income.Conclusions: These findings suggest that residential greenness has mental health benefits, and that interventions to increase urban greenness can help reduce social inequalities in mental health.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,206,,,WOS:000755119200001,10.1016/j.envres.2021.112587,,#698,Cottagiri 2022,
Higher surrounding green space is associated with better attention in Flemish adolescents,"Bijnens, EM; Vos, S; Verheyen, VV; Bruckers, L; Covaci, A; Henauw, S; Den Hond, E; Loots, I; Nelen, V; Plusquin, M; Schoeters, G; Nawrot, TS","Introduction: Previous studies suggested that green space is beneficial for the cognitive development in children. However, evidence in adolescents is limited. Therefore, we aim to investigate green space exposure in association with attention and behaviour in adolescents. Methods: This study includes 596 Flemish adolescents between 13 and 17 years old. Attention was assessed with Stroop Test (selective attention) and Continuous Performance Test (sustained and selective attention). Behaviour was determined based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Green space was estimated in several radius distances around their current residence and school based on high-resolution land cover data. Multilevel regression analyses were used adjusting for participant's age, sex, education level of the mother, and area deprivation index. Results: Surrounding green space in a 2000 m radius is associated with a faster reaction time in adolescents. An IQR (13%) increment in total green space within 2000 m of the residence and school combined, is associated with a 32.7 ms (95% CI: -58.9 to -6.5; p = 0.02) and a 7.28 ms (95% CI: -11.7 to -2.8; p = 0.001) shorter mean reaction time between the presentation of a stimulus and the response based on the Stroop Test and the Continuous Performance Test. Subdividing green space based on vegetation height, shows that green space higher than 3 m is associated with a faster reaction time of the Continuous Performance Test (-6.50 ms; 95% CI: -10.9 to -2.2; p = 0.004), while low green is not. We did not find an association between green space and behavioural development in adolescents. Conclusions: Our study shows that green space, especially trees, surrounding the residence and school combined is associated with better sustained and selected attention in adolescents. These findings indicate that the availability of green is important for adolescents that are growing up in a rapidly urbanizing world.",2022,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,159,,,WOS:000733713000011,10.1016/j.envint.2021.107016,,#717,Bijnens 2022,
Outdoor play and nature connectedness as potential correlates of internalized mental health symptoms among Canadian adolescents,"Piccininni, C; Michaelson, V; Janssen, I; Pickett, W","Exposures to outdoor environments have great potential to be protective factors for the mental health of young people. In a national analysis of Canadian adolescents, we explored how such exposures, as well as self-perceptions of connectedness with nature, each related to the prevalence of recurrent psychosomatic symptoms. The data source for this cross-sectional study, consisting of a weighted sample of 29,784 students aged 11-15 years from 377 schools, was the 2013/2014 cycle of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. We modeled reports of exposure to the outdoors and then perceived connection(s) to nature as correlates of reduced psychosomatic symptoms. Associations varied by sex. Among girls, spending on average > 0.5 h/week outdoors was associated with a 24% (95% CI: 5%, 40%) lower prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms, compared to those who averaged no time playing outdoors. No such relationship was observed among boys. Perception of connection to nature as 'important' was similarly associated with a 25% (95% CI: 9%, 38%) reduction in the prevalence of high psychosomatic symptoms; this association did not differ by sex or age. Our analysis highlights the potential importance of adolescent engagement with nature as protective for their psychological well-being. It also emphasizes the importance of accounting for differences between boys and girls when researching, planning, and implementing public mental health initiatives that consider exposure to the outdoors.",2018,,PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,112,,168-175,WOS:000432868100024,10.1016/j.ypmed.2018.04.020,,#722,Piccininni 2018,
"Availability, use of, and satisfaction with green space, and children's mental wellbeing at age 4 years in a multicultural, deprived, urban area: results from the Born in Bradford cohort study","McEachan, RRC; Yang, TC; Roberts, H; Pickett, KE; Arseneau-Powell, D; Gidlow, CJ; Wright, J; Nieuwenhuijsen, M","Background It is unknown whether the quantity or quality of green space is more important for mental wellbeing. We aimed to explore associations between availability of, satisfaction with, and use of green space and mental wellbeing among children aged 4 years in a multi-ethnic sample.Methods We did a 4-year follow-up assessment of participants in the Born in Bradford longitudinal cohort study, which recruited children and mothers at the city's main maternity unit from 2007 to 2011. The primary outcome was parentreported mental wellbeing for children aged 4 years, assessed with the standardised Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Total, internalising, and externalising behavioural difficulties and prosocial behaviour scales were computed (with higher scores indicating greater difficulties or more prosocial behaviour). Residential green space around participants' home addresses and distance to major green spaces were computed with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). A subsample of participants completed additional questionnaires on measures of satisfaction with, and use of, local green spaces. Multiple regressions examined associations between green space and children's mental wellbeing and explored moderation by ethnicity (white British vs south Asian) and socioeconomic status.Findings Between Oct 1, 2012, and June 30, 2015, 2594 mothers attended a follow-up appointment during which they completed a detailed questionnaire assessing the health of their child. 1519 (58%) participants were of south Asian origin, 740 (29%) of white British origin, and 333 (13%) of another ethnicity. Data on ethnicity were missing for two participants. 832 (32%) of 2594 participants completed additional questionnaires. Ethnicity moderated associations between residential green space and mental wellbeing (p<0.05 for total and internalising difficulties). After adjusting for all relevant variables, more green space was associated with fewer internalising behavioural difficulties (mean NDVI 100 m: beta -2.35 [95% CI -4.20 to -0.50]; 300 m: -3.15 [-5.18 to -1.13]; 500 m: -2.85 [-4.91 to -0.80]) and with fewer total behavioural difficulties (100 m: -4.27 [-7.65 to -0.90]; 300 m: -5.22 [-8.91 to -1.54]; 500 m: -4.82 [-8.57 to -1.07]) only for south Asian children across all three buffer zones. In the subsample of participants, the effect of NDVI on wellbeing was rendered non-significant after controlling for satisfaction with, and use of, green space. Among south Asian children, satisfaction with green space was significantly associated with fewer total behavioural difficulties across all three buffer zones (beta -0.59 [95% CI -1.11 to -0.07]), fewer internalising behavioural difficulties within 100 m (-0.28 [95% CI -0.56 to -0.003]) and 300 m buffer zones (-0.28 [-0.56 to -0.002]), and greater prosocial behaviour across all three buffer zones (0.20 [0.02 to 0.38]); no such associations were observed among white British children.Interpretation Positive effects of green space on wellbeing differ by ethnicity. Satisfaction with the quality of green space appears to be a more important predictor of wellbeing than does quantity of green space. Public health professionals and urban planners need to focus on both quality and quantity of urban green spaces to promote health, particularly among ethnic minority groups.

"Urban forest benefits to the younger population: The case study of the city of Belgrade, Serbia","Vujcic, M; Tomicevic-Dubljevic, J","In the modem world, industrial and technological development resulted in many challenges to general health and urban planning so the evaluation of natural resources has become a social need for overcoming these problems. Nowadays, the different forms of urban green areas represent one of the most important elements of the built environment, which directly affect physical activity, health, and mortality. This paper analyses the perceived health benefits of the students-volunteers who agreed to spend five consecutive weeks of their recess time in an existing Arboretum in the city of Belgrade. The aim of this study is to gain some basic knowledge of the restorative potential of the urban forest environment and to identify perceived physical, mental and social benefits of the younger population using a survey. The survey was analysed by an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Additionally, DASS21 was used for psychometric evaluation of the mental well-being of respondents so the control group was included. The two-factor analysis of data on the total score recorded marginally significant interaction testing between the groups (F-1.45 = 3.781; p < .058), indicating a higher tendency to the stress reduction at the arboretum group. Further, the findings from the IPA indicate that the spatial qualities such as such greenery, lawn, and benches are important for the restorative experience in an Arboretum. The research outputs indicate that the urban forest environment in the city of Belgrade has a potential to support restorative experience and daily habits of a younger population.",2018,,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,96,,54-62,WOS:000445985000006,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.006,,#734,Vujcic 2018,

Using data from an 18-country survey (n=16,307) we explored associations between multiple measures of mental health (positive well-being, mental distress, depression/anxiety medication use) and: (a) exposures (residential/recreational visits) to different natural settings (green/inland-blue/coastal-blue spaces); and (b) nature connectedness, across season and country. People who lived in greener/coastal neighbourhoods reported higher positive well-being, but this association largely disappeared when recreational visits were controlled for. Frequency of recreational visits to green, inland-blue, and coastal-blue spaces in the last 4 weeks were all positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress. Associations with green space visits were relatively consistent across seasons and countries but associations with blue space visits showed greater heterogeneity. Nature connectedness was also positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress and was, along with green space visits, associated with a lower likelihood of using medication for depression. By contrast inland-blue space visits were associated with a greater likelihood of using anxiety medication.

Results of the Pro-Saude Study,"Barreto, PA; Lopes, CS; da Silveira, IH; Faerstein, E; Junger, WL","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between exposure to green areas in the surroundings of the residence and the presence of common mental disorders among adults, according to different income strata.METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 2,584 participants from the Pro-Saude Study (2006), residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Common Mental Disorders were measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and exposure to green areas was measured using the normalized difference vegetation index, in buffers with radiuses between 100 and 1,500 meters around the residence. We used the mean and maximum normalized difference vegetation index categorized into quartiles. The study population was divided into three subgroups, according to the income: low, intermediate, and high. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated with logistic regression models. The models were adjusted by sex and age, with and without inclusion of physical activity practice.RESULTS: The proportion of common mental disorders was 30% and 39% among men and women, respectively. The results of the adjusted models showed an inverse association between the presence of green areas in the surroundings of the residence and the occurrence of common mental disorders, in the buffer of 200 meters in the intermediate-income group and in the buffers of 400 and 1,500 meters in the low-income group. The odds ratio ranged from 0.52 (buffer of 1,500 meters) to 0.68 (buffer of 200 meters). The association found was independent of physical activity practice.CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found suggests the existence of a beneficial effect of urban green areas on the mental health of lower-income individuals.

Relationships between Characteristics of Urban Green Land Cover and Mental Health in US Metropolitan Areas,"Tsai, WL; McHale, MR; Jennings, V; Marquet, O; Hipp, JA; Leung, YF; Floyd, MF","Urbanization increases risk for depression and other mental disorders. A growing body of research indicates the natural environment confers numerous psychological benefits including alleviation of mental distress. This study examined land cover types and landscape metrics in relation to mental health for 276 U.S. counties within metropolitan areas having a population of 1 million or more. County Health Rankings and Behavioral Risk and Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provided a measure of mental health. The 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provided data on green land cover types, from which seven landscape metrics were generated to characterize landscape patterns. Spearman's rho correlation and stepwise logistic regression models, respectively, were employed to examine bivariate and multivariate relationships. Models were adjusted for county population and housing density, region, race, and income to account for potential confounding. Overall, individual measures of landscape patterns showed stronger associations with mental health than percent total cover alone. Greater edge contrast was associated with 3.81% lower odds of Frequent Mental Distress (FMD) (Adjusted Odd's Ratio (AOR) = 0.9619, 95% CI = 0.9371, 0.9860). Shrubland cohesion was associated with greater odds of FMD (AOR = 1.0751, 95% CI = 1.0196, 1.1379). In addition, distance between shrubland cover was associated with greater odds of FMD (AOR = 1.0027, 95% CI = 1.0016, 1.0041). Although effect sizes were small, findings suggest different types of landscape characteristics may have different roles in improving mental health.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,15,2,,WOS:000426721400165,10.3390/ijerph15020340,,#765,Tsai 2018,

There was limited evidence that greenspace was related to the change of anxiety symptoms over time. No association with anxiety trajectories was found when considering distance to nearest greenspace (proximity), highlighting potentially differential mental health effects of simply having access to local parks and recreation areas versus living in areas of greater natural environment land cover.

It makes use of the longitudinal COVID-19 Public Experiences (COPE) study, with baseline data collected in March/ April 2020 (during the first peak) and follow-up data collected in June/July 2020 (after the first peak) which included an optional module that asked respondents about their home and neighbourhood (n = 5,566). Regression analyses revealed that both perceived access to public green space (e.g. a park or woodland) and reported access to a private green space (a private garden) were associated with better subjective wellbeing and self-rated health. In line with the health compensation hypothesis for green space, private gardens had a greater protective effect where the nearest green space was perceived to be more than a 10-minute walk away. This interaction was however only present during the first COVID-19 peak when severe lockdown restrictions came into place, but not in the post-peak period when restrictions were being eased. The study found few differences across demographic groups. A private garden was relatively more beneficial for men than for women during but not after the first peak.

Spatial statistical analysis of the relationship between self-reported mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown and closeness to green infrastructure,"Jato-Espino, D; Moscardo, V; Rodriguez, AV; Lazaro, E","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced alterations in the behaviour and psychological health of people, who have had to learn living under uncertain circumstances escaping their control. This situation has been aggravated in those countries applying strict home confinement rules to try bending their epidemic curve. This is the case of Spain, where the stringent lockdown period was extended over three months. This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure (GI) during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health. To this end, La Palma (Canary Islands) and Zaragoza (Peninsular Spain) were taken as case studies, since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenry's self-reported mental health under strict lockdown conditions. A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress, anger, medication use, alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI, whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas. Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis, they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation, aesthetical or sporting purposes. The joint consideration of these psychological gains with the social and environmental benefits provided by GI emphasizes the importance of approaching urban regeneration through the design and implementation of interconnected green spaces.",2022,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,68,,,WOS:000789609400001,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127457,,#789,Jato-Espino 2022,

However, in the abundant literature on how urban green space promotes human health and well-being, research on urban seasonal deciduous forests is limited. This study aimed to investigate the physiological and psychological recovery potential provided of urban deciduous forest space for youths and the spatial preferences of youths regarding such spaces. We recruited 120 participants to study the restorative potential of two typical urban deciduous forest landscape spaces (experimental groups) and one urban road environment (control group). The results showed that after 15 min of observation, the blood pressure (especially the diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.01)) and pulse of the deciduous forest trail setting (DFTS) group effectively decreased, and the restorative mood significantly increased. Regarding change in emotional parameters, the DFTS group scored higher on ""interest"" and significantly higher than the other two groups on positive emotion. The correlation results show that density and level are the key factors affecting spatial preferences regarding complex deciduous forests. An increase in density reduces the mood of re-laxation, and an increase in level decreases fatigue and interest. We suggest (1) constructing foot-paths in urban deciduous forests to reduce their spatial density as to improve the relaxation effect and (2) increasing landscape diversity according to the forest space to facilitate user participation and interest.

"The role of public and private natural space in children's social, emotional and behavioural development in Scotland: A longitudinal study","Richardson, EA; Pearce, J; Shortt, NK; Mitchell, R","Introduction: Poor mental health in childhood has implications for health and wellbeing in later life. Natural space may benefit children's social, emotional and behavioural development. We investigated whether neighbourhood natural space and private garden access were related to children's developmental change over time. We asked whether relationships differed between boys and girls, or by household educational status.Methods: We analysed longitudinal data for 2909 urban-dwelling children (aged 4 at 2008/9 baseline) from the Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) survey. The survey provided social, emotional and behavioural difficulty scores (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)), and private garden access. Area (%) of total natural space and parks within 500 m of the child's home was quantified using Scotland's Greenspace Map. Interactions for park area, total natural space area, and private garden access with age and age(2) were modelled to quantify their independent contributions to SDQ score change over time.Results: Private garden access was strongly related to most SDQ domains, while neighbourhood natural space was related to better social outcomes. We found little evidence that neighbourhood natural space or garden access influenced the trajectory of developmental change between 4 and 6 years, suggesting that any beneficial influences had occurred at younger ages. Stratified models showed the importance of parks for boys, and private gardens for the early development of children from low-education households.Conclusion: We conclude that neighbourhood natural space may reduce social, emotional and behavioural difficulties for 4-6 year olds, although private garden access may be most beneficial.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,158,,729-736,WOS:000408184700079,10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.038,,#799,Richardson 2017,
Multiple environmental burdens and neighborhood-related health of city residents,"Honold, J; Beyer, R; Lakes, T; van der Meer, E","Urban living environments are known to influence human well-being and health; however, little is known about the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens. The aim of this study is to examine the relations between multiple burdens and self-rated health of city residents in Berlin. A spatial analysis was conducted to determine neighborhood street blocks with high versus low levels of three environmental burdens (traffic noise, air pollution, lack of public green space) as study sites for a cross-sectional household questionnaire. Burden level served as a dichotomous predictor to compare residents' self-reports of neighborhood satisfaction, life satisfaction, health behavior, and psychological and physical health symptoms. Residents from high-burden blocks appraised the environmental conditions more stressful, reported poorer health behavior and were less satisfied with their neighborhood than residents from low-burden blocks. However, they did not differ in regard to more general health symptoms. Three other burdens (behavior-related noise, litter and dirt in public space, lack of urban vegetation), which could not be varied objectively, were assessed by their perceived intensity. Regression analyses of the relations between the perceived levels of all six burdens and outcomes in the total sample revealed the following: Neighborhood satisfaction could be predicted from multiple stressors and resources that co-occur independently, while more general health symptoms were related only to perceived air pollution.

This study investigated how exposure to one's everyday natural outdoor environments over one week influenced mood among residents of four European cities including Barcelona (Spain), Stoke-on-Trent (United Kingdom), Doetinchem (The Netherlands) and Kaunas (Lithuania). Participants (n = 368) wore a smartphone equipped with software applications to track location and mood (using mobile ecological momentary assessment (EMA) software), for seven consecutive days. We estimated random-effects ordered logistic regression models to examine the association between mood (positive and negative affect), and exposure to green space, represented by two binary variables indicating exposure versus no exposure to NOE using GPS tracking and satellite and aerial imagery, 10 and 30 min prior to participants' completing the EMA. Models were adjusted for home city, day of the week, hour of the day, EMA survey type, residential NOE exposure, and sex, age, education level, mental health status and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. In addition, we tested for heterogeneity of effect by city, sex, age, residential NOE exposure and mental health status. Within 10 min of NOE exposure, compared to non-exposure, we found that overall there was a positive relationship with positive affect (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) of EMA surveys, and non-significant negative association with negative affect (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.10). When stratifying, associations were consistently found for Stoke-on-Trent inhabitants and men, while findings by age group were inconsistent. Weaker and less consistent associations were found for exposure 30 min prior to EMA.

This study aims to explore biopsychosocial pathways linking residential greenness exposure to depression in the Chinese context using data from the 2016 wave of China Labour-force Dynamics Survey. Results from multilevel models along with mediation analysis show that exposure to residential greenness is negatively associated with depression, and that physical activity, stress and neighbourhood social cohesion altogether have a complete mediation effect on this association. Results from moderation analysis suggest that urbanicity moderates the relationship between greenness exposure and depression, and that the relationship is strongest at the upper level of urbanicity.

Park Proximity and Use for Physical Activity among Urban Residents: Associations with Mental Health,"Orstad, SL; Szuhany, K; Tamura, K; Thorpe, LE; Jay, M","Increasing global urbanization limits interaction between people and natural environments, which may negatively impact population health and wellbeing. Urban residents who live near parks report better mental health. Physical activity (PA) reduces depression and improves quality of life. Despite PA's protective effects on mental health, the added benefit of urban park use for PA is unclear. Thus, we examined whether park-based PA mediated associations between park proximity and mental distress among 3652 New York City residents (61.4% 45 + years, 58.9% female, 56.3% non-white) who completed the 2010-2011 Physical Activity and Transit (PAT) random-digit-dial survey. Measures included number of poor mental health days in the previous month (outcome), self-reported time to walk to the nearest park from home (exposure), and frequency of park use for sports, exercise or PA (mediator). We used multiple regression with bootstrap-generated 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (BC CIs) to test for mediation by park-based PA and moderation by gender, dog ownership, PA with others, and perceived park crime. Park proximity was indirectly associated with fewer days of poor mental health via park-based PA, but only among those not concerned about park crime (index of moderated mediation = 0.04; SE = 0.02; 95% BC CI = 0.01, 0.10).

Yet few studies have systematically examined the impact of the neighborhood-level built-environment and social environment on mental health within different localities in the Chinese context. Based on a household survey and geographical data in Guangzhou, China, this study aimed to explore the linkage between the neighborhood environment and mental health, with a particular focus on aspects of the built-environment that are related to new urbanism or compact cities and contextual social capital, using three geographic delineations. Our findings indicated that built-environment indicators based on a road network buffer had a higher explanatory power towards residents' mental health than did those based on a circular buffer. The analytical models demonstrated that neighborhood floor-area ratio, building density, and per capita green area were positively correlated with mental health. Neighborhood safety and contextual neighborhood interactions and reciprocity had positive associations with mental health.

Urban public parks and mental health in adult women: Mediating and moderating factors,"Bojorquez, I; Ojeda-Revah, L","Background: The association of green spaces such as urban public parks and mental health might vary according to personal characteristics and characteristics of the park and be mediated by the use of the park. Aims: We investigate the association between urban public park coverage and mental health in adult women, the moderation of this association by personal and park-related characteristics, and the mediation of the association by use of public space. Methods: Combining data from a cross-sectional survey of the adult female population of Tijuana (Mexico) in 2014, and a study of public spaces in 2013, we analyzed the association between park coverage in buffers of 400 and 800 m from participants' homes and score in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). We tested for mediation by use of park and interaction of urban park coverage with personal and park characteristics. Results: Urban public park coverage in the 400-m buffer had an inverse association with CES-D score that was moderated by age (significant only for younger participants), with no evidence of mediation. Park coverage in the 800-m buffer also had an inverse association with CES-D score, moderated by age and occupation (significant for younger participants and homemakers), and a mediated association was also observed. There was no interaction between park coverage and park characteristics in their association with CES-D score. Conclusion: Our results confirm the potential of public parks to improve mental health and suggest that this effect could be more important at some stages in the life course for women.

Association of the Built Environment With Childhood Psychosocial Stress,"Franklin, M; Yin, XZ; McConnell, R; Fruin, S","Importance Emerging research suggests that factors associated with the built environment, including artificial light, air pollution, and noise, may adversely affect children's mental health, while living near green space may reduce stress. Little is known about the combined roles of these factors on children's stress. Objective To investigate associations between components of the built environment with personal and home characteristics in a large cohort of children who were assessed for perceived stress. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, a total of 2290 Southern California Children's Health Study participants residing in 8 densely populated urban communities responded to detailed questionnaires. Exposures of artificial light at night (ALAN) derived from satellite observations, near-roadway air pollution (NRP) determined from a dispersion model, noise estimated from the US Traffic Noise Model, and green space from satellite observations of the enhanced vegetation index were linked to each participant's geocoded residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Children's stress was assessed at ages 13 to 14 years and 15 to 16 years using the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), scaled from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress. Measurements were conducted in 2010 and 2012, and data were analyzed from February 6 to August 24, 2019. Multivariate mixed-effects models were used to examine multiple exposures; modification and mediation analyses were also conducted. Results Among the 2290 children in this study, 1149 were girls (50%); mean (SD) age was 13.5 (0.6) years. Girls had significantly higher perceived stress measured by PSS-4 (mean [SD] score, 5.7 [3.4]) than boys (4.9 [3.2]). With increasing age (from 13.5 [0.6] to 15.3 [0.6] years), the mean PSS-4 score rose from 5.6 (3.3) to 6.0 (3.4) in girls but decreased for boys from 5.0 (3.2) to 4.7 (3.1). Multivariate mixed-effects models examining multiple exposures indicated that exposure to secondhand smoke in the home was associated with a 0.85 (95% CI, 0.46-1.24) increase in the PSS-4 score. Of the factors related to the physical environment, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in ALAN was associated with a 0.57 (95% CI, 0.05-1.09) unit increase in the PSS-4 score together with a 0.16 score increase per IQR increase of near-roadway air pollution (95% CI, 0.02-0.30) and a -0.24 score decrease per IQR increase of the enhanced vegetation index (95% CI, -0.45 to -0.04). Income modified the ALAN effect size estimate; participants in households earning less than $48000 per year had significantly greater stress per IQR increase in ALAN. Sleep duration partially mediated the associations between stress and both enhanced vegetation index (17%) and ALAN (18%). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, children's exposure to smoke at home in addition to residential exposure to ALAN and near-roadway air pollution were associated with increased perceived stress among young adolescent children. These associations appeared to be partially mitigated by more residential green space. The findings may support the promotion of increased residential green spaces to reduce pollution associated with the built environment, with possible mental health benefits for children.Question Are environmental exposures, including artificial light at night (ALAN), near-roadway air pollution, noise, green space, and secondhand smoke, associated with childhood psychosocial stress? Findings In this cohort study of 2290 children, perceived stress was significantly associated with increased ALAN, near-roadway air pollution, and exposure to secondhand smoke at home, while residential green space appeared to partially mitigate the associations with these factors. Income appeared to modify the ALAN effect size estimate and sleep duration to partially mediate the associations between stress and both green space and ALAN.

Levels of Nature and Stress Response,"Ewert, A; Chang, Y","A growing number of studies have shown that visiting green spaces and being exposed to natural environments can reduce psychological stress. A number of questions concerning the effects of natural environments on levels of stress remain including, ""Are activities engaged in natural environments more or less beneficial at reducing stress when compared to those done in more urban settings?"" This study examined this question from the perspective of ""levels of nature"". That is, data on levels of stress were collected from three sites, one site having wilderness-like characteristics, a second site representing a municipal-type park, and a third site representing a built environment (indoor exercise facility) within a city. Data were generated using biophysical markers (cortisol and amylase) and a psychological measure within a pre- and post-visit format. Findings suggest that visiting natural environments can be beneficial in reducing both physical and psychological stress levels, with visitors to a natural environment reporting significantly lower levels of stress than their counterparts visiting a more urbanized outdoor setting or indoor exercise facility.",2018,,BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES,8,5,,WOS:000435190400008,10.3390/bs8050049,,#830,Ewert 2018,
The human posterior cingulate and the stress-response benefits of viewing green urban landscapes,"Chang, DHF; Jiang, B; Wong, NHL; Wong, JJ; Webster, C; Lee, TMC","The mechanistic and neural bases of why green environments drive positive mental health outcomes remain poorly understood. We show that viewing green urban landscapes that vary in terms of green-space density elicits corresponding changes in the activity of the human ventral posterior cingulate cortex that is correlated to behavioural stress-related responses. We further show that cingulate responses are engaged early in the processing cascade, influencing attentional and executive regions in a predominantly feedforward manner. Our data suggest a key role for this region in regulating (nature) dose-dependent changes in stress responses, potentially through its extensive connections to the prefrontal and hippocampal regions which in turn project towards the neuroendocrine system. As the posterior cingulate cortex is implicated in a variety of neurological diseases and disorders, these findings raise a therapeutic potential for natural environmental exposure, highlighting green-cover as a modifiable element that links to changes in limbic responses, and has health consequences for practitioners and city-planners alike.",2021,,NEUROIMAGE,226,,,WOS:000608035900031,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117555,,#832,Chang 2021,

The Impact of the Environment on the Quality of Life and the Mediating Effects of Sleep and Stress,"Chang, KKP; Wong, FKY; Chan, KL; Wong, F; Ho, HC; Wong, MS; Ho, YS; Yuen, JWM; Siu, JYM; Yang, L","(1) Background: Environment is an independent factor that affects one's quality of life (QoL), where studies suggest that health behaviours also affect one's quality of life. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between environmental conditions and QoL and how individual health behaviours affect this association. (2) Methods: Participants aged 20 or above were recruited from 11 tertiary planning units in the central part of Kowloon. These tertiary planning units were selected as they represented the overall living environment in Hong Kong, with a mix of the poorer urban areas alongside relatively affluent districts. A mediation analysis was implemented using multiple linear regressions to examine the effects of environmental conditions on QoL. (3) Results: Of the 607 eligible participants included for analysis, 390 were female and 217 were male, with a mean age of 47.4 years. Living within 500 m of a green space area had benefits on the physical aspect of QoL and physical activity but no effect on the psychological aspect of QoL. Moderate satisfaction with public spaces affected QoL positively. In contrast, less satisfaction with public spaces affected QoL negatively in both physical and psychological aspects through the mediating effect of stress. Poor environmental quality affected all domains of QoL negatively through the mediating effects of increased stress and poor sleep. (4) Conclusions: Environment is an important factor that affects individuals' overall well-being. The interaction between environmental conditions and individual variables, especially perceived stress and sleep, is extremely important when assessing its impact on QoL. The findings of this study support the importance of individual stress and sleep in mediating the relationship between the environment and QoL for health.

Associations of green space metrics with health and behavior outcomes at different buffer sizes and remote sensing sensor resolutions,"Su, JG; Dadvand, P; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ; Bartoll, X; Jerrett, M","Satellite data is increasingly used to characterize green space for health outcome studies. Literature suggests that green space within 500 m of home is often used to represent neighborhood suitable for walking, air pollution and noise reduction, and natural healing. In this paper, we used satellite data of different spatial resolutions to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator of surface greenness, at buffer distances of 50, 100, 250 and 500 m. Data included those of 2 m spatial resolution from WorldView2, 5 m resolution from RapidEye and 30 m resolution from Landsat. We found that, after radiometric calibrations, the RapidEye and WorldView2 sensors had similar NDVI values, while Landsat imagery tended to have greater NDVI; however, these sensors showed similar vegetation distribution: locations high in vegetation cover being high in NDVI, and vice versa. We linked the green space estimates to a health survey, and identified that higher NDVI values were significantly associated with better health outcomes. We further investigated the impacts of buffer size and sensor spatial resolution on identified associations between NDVI and health outcomes. Overall, the identified health outcomes were similar across sensors of different spatial resolutions, but a mean trend was identified in bigger buffer size being associated with greater health outcome.",2019,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,126,,162-170,WOS:000462597500019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.02.008,,#840,Su 2019,
Urban greenery and mental wellbeing in adults: Cross-sectional mediation analyses on multiple pathways across different greenery measures,"Wang, RY; Helbich, M; Yao, Y; Zhang, JB; Liu, PH; Yuan, Y; Liu, Y","Background: Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how greenery in the vicinity of peoples homes enhances their mental health and wellbeing. Mediation studies, however, focus on a limited number of mechanisms and rely on remotely sensed greenery measures, which do not accurately capture how neighborhood greenery is perceived on the ground.Objective: To examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect peoples mental wellbeing; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred.Methods: We used a population sample of 1029 adult residents of the metropolis of Guangzhou, China, from 2016. Mental wellbeing was quantified by the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Two objective greenery measures were extracted at the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a convolutional neural network, and 2) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Single and multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted. Results: Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for 22% of the association.Conclusions: Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and satellite-derived greenery seem to be both directly correlated and indirectly mediated.

The development of an urban greenway (9 km running along 3 rivers) in Northern Ireland provided the opportunity to conduct a natural experiment. This study investigated the public health impact of the urban greenway on a range of physical activity, health, wellbeing, social, and perceptions of the environment outcomes. Methods A repeated cross-sectional household survey of adult residents (aged >= 16 years) who lived <= 1-mile radius of the greenway (intervention sample) and > 1-mile radius of the greenway (control sample) was conducted pre (2010/2011) and 6-months post implementation (2016/2017). We assessed changes in outcomes pre- and post-intervention follow-up including physical activity behaviour (primary outcome measure: Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), quality of life, mental wellbeing, social capital and perceptions of the built environment. Linear regression was used to calculate the mean difference between post-intervention and baseline measures adjusting for age, season, education, car ownership and deprivation. Multi-level models were fitted using a random intercept at the super output area (smallest geographical unit) to account for clustering within areas. The analyses were stratified by distance from the greenway and deprivation. We assessed change in the social patterning of outcomes over time using an ordered logit to make model-based outcome predictions across strata. Results The mean ages of intervention samples were 50.3 (SD 18.9) years at baseline (n = 1037) and 51.7 (SD 19.1) years at follow-up (n = 968). Post-intervention, 65% (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.00) of residents who lived closest to the greenway (i.e., <= 400 m) and 60% (adjusted OR, 0.64 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99) who lived furthest from the greenway (i.e.,>= 1200 m) met the physical activity guidelines - 68% of the intervention sample met the physical activity guidelines before the intervention. Residents in the most deprived quintiles had a similar reduction in physical activity behaviour as residents in less deprived quintiles. Quality of life at follow-up compared to baseline declined and this decline was significantly less than in the control area (adjusted differences in mean EQ5D: -11.0 (95% CI - 14.5 to - 7.4); - 30.5 (95% CI - 37.9 to - 23.2). Significant change in mental wellbeing was not observed despite improvements in some indicators of social capital. Positive perceptions of the local environment in relation to its attractiveness, traffic and safety increased. Conclusions Our findings illustrate the major challenge of evaluating complex urban interventions and the difficulty of capturing and measuring the network of potential variables that influence or hinder meaningful outcomes. The results indicate at this stage no intervention effect for improvements in population-level physical activity behaviour or mental wellbeing. However, they show some modest improvements for secondary outcomes including positive perceptions of the environment and social capital constructs.

Window view and relaxation: Viewing green space from a high-rise estate improves urban dwellers' wellbeing,"Elsadek, M; Liu, BY; Xie, JF","The current challenges of urbanization and densification threaten the health of urban dwellers. Previous studies have shown that contact with; or perception of green spaces has beneficial impacts on human psychological wellbeing. However, residents and employees who live or work in high-rise buildings have little opportunity to access green spaces during working hours. We do not know whether viewing green space through a high-rise estate window can potentially contribute to the psychological wellbeing of urban dwellers. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to two offices, a window looking out onto urban space, or a window looking out onto green space from a wide-angle of the 21st floor of the Jin-Mao Tower. During visual stimulation, sensors took physiological measures of their stress levels by measuring Electroencephalography, heart rate variability, and skin conductance, while their psychological reactions were collected using Profile of Mood States and Semantic Differential Questionnaire. Results showed that compared with the urban space view; viewing green space through a high-rise window resulted in a significant increase in alpha wave power in the frontal and occipital lobes, a significant increase in parasympathetic activity; and a significant decrease in the skin conductance. Moreover; a significant increase in ""comfortable"", ""beautiful"", ""attractive"", ""relaxed"", and ""cheerful'' feelings, and a significant improvement in mood states.

Childhood NOE exposure was not associated with vitality. Low levels of childhood NOE exposure were associated with lower importance of NOE (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66, 0.98) in adulthood. The association with perceived amount of NOE differed between cities. We found no evidence for mediation. Childhood NOE exposure might be associated with mental well-being in adulthood. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify mechanisms underlying long-term benefits of childhood NOE exposure.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,10,,WOS:000470967500143,10.3390/ijerph16101809,,#865,Preuss 2019,
"Objective and perceived built environment, sense of community, and mental wellbeing in older adults in Hong Kong: A multilevel structural equation study","Guo, YQ; Liu, YQ; Lu, SY; Chan, OF; Chui, CHK; Lum, TYS","Studies have indicated that a sense of community may be shaped by the built environment and has potential mental wellbeing implications. However, few studies have explored this pathway empirically. Moreover, research has rarely differentiated the role of objective and perceived built environment. Based on a survey of 1,553 older adults undertaken between 2015 and 2017 in Hong Kong, we explored the distal mediation pathway from objective built environment to both mental health and subjective wellbeing through perceived built environment and sense of community, using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed that perceived built environment and sense of community can fully explain the residential density and subjective wellbeing relationship. The inverted U-shape relationship between street connectivity and mental health was identified. Park-based green space had a protective role for both mental health and subjective wellbeing and was explained by two mediators, but vegetation-based green space was negatively associated with subjective well-being. Land use mix had positive total effects on both mental health and subjective wellbeing and was partially mediated by perceived built environment and sense of community. Recreational services showed a protective effect on both mental health and subjective wellbeing, and both were partially mediated by two mediators. The negative direct effect of health services on subjective wellbeing offsets the positive indirect effect through two mediators. The study findings have implications for landscape and urban planning policy and can provide an empirical contribution to the theoretical foundation of aging in place.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,209,,,WOS:000624918300004,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104058,,#867,Guo 2021,
Association Between Urban Greenspace and Mental Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a US Cohort,"Wortzel, JD; Wiebe, DJ; DiDomenico, GE; Visoki, E; South, E; Tam, V; Greenberg, DM; Brown, LA; Gur, RC; Gur, RE; Barzilay, R","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought unprecedented socially isolating measures to mitigate the spread of disease, heightening the importance of public outdoor urban greenspace. Here, we investigated the association between tree-rich greenspace and mental health in a large opportunity sample surveyed using a crowdsourcing research website (www.covid19resilience.org) between April 6th and October 12th, 2020 during the pandemic in the United States. Participants living in the U.S. (N = 2,089, 83.1% females, mean age 42 years, age range 18-90 years) were mapped to 1,080 unique ZIP Codes and mean tree canopy density was calculated with a 250m buffer around each ZIP Code grouped by quartile as a proxy for nearby greenspace. Four mental health parameters were assessed: (1) COVID-19-related worries; (2) anxiety symptoms; (3) depression symptoms; and (4) a standardized and weighted composite mental health score of all three parameters. Multivariate regression analyses with multilevel models were used to study the association between nearby greenspace and the four mental health outcomes, controlling for participant demographics and ZIP Code urbanicity. In the entire cohort, increased nearby greenspace showed a significant protective effect for depression (Coef. = -0.27; p = 0.0499), and composite mental health scores (Coef. = -0.19; p = 0.038) when comparing ZIP Codes with the most greenspace to ZIP Codes with the least, with no observed effects on COVID-19 related worries or anxiety individually. Stratifying by age suggested protective trends of greenspace on mental health in older subsets of the population (top age quartile, over 51 years old) experiencing less depression (Coef. = -0.45; p = 0.048) and lower composite mental health scores (Coef. = -0.34; - = 0.032) as a function of nearby greenspace. Additionally, younger subsets of the population (second youngest age quartile, 31-38 years) experienced lower COVID-19 related worries (Coef. = -1.34; p = 0.022) as a function of greenspace. These findings may indicate that tree-rich greenspace plays a protective role on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in certain age groups, supporting the use of greenspace-related strategies to help mitigate mental health burden during this challenging and isolating time.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES,3,,,WOS:000751872400070,10.3389/frsc.2021.686159,,#868,Wortzel 2021,
"""It made me feel brighter in myself""- The health and well-being impacts of a residential front garden horticultural intervention","Chalmin-Pui, LS; Roe, J; Griffiths, A; Smyth, N; Heaton, T; Clayden, A; Cameron, R","Residential gardens make up 30% of urban space in the UK, yet unlike many other green space typologies, their role in the health and well-being agenda has largely been overlooked. A horticultural intervention introduced ornamental plants to 38 previously bare front gardens (approximate to 10 m(2)) within an economically deprived region of North England, UK. Measures of perceived stress and diurnal cortisol profiles (as an indicator of health status) were taken preand post-intervention (over 3 months). Residents reported significant decreases in perceived stress post-intervention. This finding was aligned with a higher proportion of 'healthy' diurnal cortisol patterns post-intervention, suggesting better health status in those individuals. All residents derived one or more reported socio-cultural benefits as a result of the front garden plantings, although overall scores for subjective well-being did not increase to a significant level. Further qualitative data suggested that the gardens were valued for enhancing relaxation, increasing positive emotions, motivation, and pride of place. The results indicate that adding even small quantities of ornamental plants to front gardens within deprived urban communities had a positive effect on an individual's stress regulation and some, but not all, aspects of subjective well-being. The research highlights the importance of residential front gardens to human health and well-being, and thus their contribution to the wider debates around city densification, natural capital and urban planning.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,205,,,WOS:000589911800003,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103958,,#876,Chalmin-Pui 2021,
"Are greenspace attributes associated with perceived restorativeness? A comparative study of urban cemeteries and parks in Edinburgh, Scotland","Lai, KY; Sarkar, C; Sun, ZW; Scott, I","The health effects of under-utilized and passive greenspace with specialist functions, for example the urban cemetery have been rarely studied. In this study, we aim to examine the differences in the associations between greenspace attributes and perceived restorativeness (defined as recovering from mental fatigue) across two urban greenspace typologies; namely, parks and cemeteries. Among sub-samples of the study participants, this research further explores if social (i.e., having knowledge of or a previous relationship to a deceased person interred in the cemetery) and geographical distance (i.e., residential street distance to the cemetery) had significant beneficial effect upon participants' perceived restorativeness. A face-to-face on-site survey was conducted in Edinburgh comprising N-1 = 113 and N-2 = 120 participants from parks and cemeteries respectively. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to measure the distance from interviewees' home to the study sites, while multivariate linear regression models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates assessed the strength and significance of the associations. Among the greenspace attributes, pleasantness and aesthetic quality remained significant predictors of perceived restorativeness in case of both parks and cemeteries. In addition, safety was significantly associated with perceived restorativeness in the park-exposure group, whereas presence of good paths was significant only in the cemetery-exposure group. Significant effects of greenspace attributes upon restorativeness were reported only among participants without a deceased person interred in the cemetery and those residing beyond a distance of 800 meters. The study findings advance our knowledge of the restorativeness of specific greenspace features in the parks and cemeteries and point to the need to integrate cemetery strategy with the local authority's urban greenspace planning and policy for optimizing the use of these thus far passive green areas.",2020,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,53,,,WOS:000559091000003,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126720,,#881,Lai 2020,

Few studies, however, have been conducted in megacities in low-/middle-income countries, which have extremely complex urban arrangements. Objective We analyzed land cover using the population database of the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey (n = 4287) and the associations with the diagnosis of depression/anxiety. Methodology Automatic classification of the orthophotos of the metropolitan area was performed using the random forest algorithm to provide land cover variables. The association of mental health data with land cover was determined with logistic regression and multilevel regression models. Results The percentage of different green spaces, mainly grassed areas, within districts was negatively associated with the presence of anxiety (OR 0.994, 0.968, 0.994, respectively), while roofs, asphalt and shadow (OR 1.007, 1.021, 1.085, 1.021, 1.014, respectively) were positively associated with the presence of anxiety.

"Linking green space to health: a comparative study of two urban neighbourhoods in Ghent, Belgium","Van Herzele, A; de Vries, S","This paper investigates the nature of the relationship between the greenness of the local environment and the health and well-being of its inhabitants by looking at a number of possible mediators within the same study: physical activity, perceived stress, ability to concentrate, social cohesion and neighbourhood satisfaction. Data were collected through a survey of residents in two neighbourhoods that differ objectively in green space provision, but which are largely similar in demographics, socio-economic factors, housing conditions and other environmental characteristics, apart from green space. Of the three dependent variables of interest: self-reported general health, bodily functioning and general well-being (happiness), it was self-reported happiness that differed significantly between the two neighbourhoods, with greater happiness in the greener neighbourhood. Amongst the possible mediators, people's satisfaction with their neighbourhood differed significantly: those living in the greener neighbourhood were more satisfied. Mediation analysis indicated that neighbourhood satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between neighbourhood greenness and happiness. Among the specific (environmental and social) neighbourhood qualities asked about, perception of neighbourhood greenness was found to be the most important predictor of neighbourhood satisfaction. Additional analysis showed that the view from the living room-green or not green-fully mediates the relationship between neighbourhood greenness and neighbourhood satisfaction. This study underscores the importance of nearby green space for people's overall well-being and suggests the need for green space to be evaluated in terms of visual proximity, that is, whether and how it is experienced from the street and the home.",2012,,POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT,34,2,171-193,WOS:000310813300001,10.1007/s11111-011-0153-1,,#886,VanHerzele 2012,

Meanwhile, urban planners and policy-makers are increasingly aware that urban greenery may mitigate the detrimental effects of crowded environments on quality of life in high-density cities. However, little empirical evidence is available in the context of China. This study aims to examine the complex relationship between urban density, urban greenery, and older people's life satisfaction, with survey data collected from 1,594 older adults in 129 neighborhoods in Shanghai, China. Urban density was assessed using floor area ratio and building coverage ratio respectively, and urban greenery was measured by street view greenery, greening rate, Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), and accessibility to nearest parks. Results from structural equation modeling showed that higher urban density was related to lower life satisfaction, and a reduced sense of community was a significant pathway between higher urban density and lower life satisfaction. Furthermore, eye-level greenery cushioned the negative effect of urban density on life satisfaction. Our findings highlighted the necessity of optimizing high-density neighborhood environments and promoting eye-level greenery in high-density urban areas to create aging-friendly cities.",2022,,CITIES,124,,,WOS:000753653900008,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103607,,#887,He 2022,

We hypothesized that stress-related brain activation in regions important for emotion regulation were associated positively with green space and associated negatively with air pollution and noise pollution. A higher percentage of green space was associated with stronger parietal and insular activation during stress compared with that in the control condition. More air pollution was associated with weaker activation in the same (but also extended) brain regions.

It is also well known that participation in regular physical activity generates physical and psychological health bene. fits. The authors have hypothesised that 'green exercise' will improve health and psychological well-being, yet few studies have quantified these effects. This study measured the effects of 10 green exercise case studies ( including walking, cycling, horse-riding, fishing, canal-boating and conservation activities) in four regions of the UK on 263 participants. Even though these participants were generally an active and healthy group, it was found that green exercise led to a significant improvement in self-esteem and total mood disturbance ( with anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection and tension-anxiety all improving post-activity). Self-esteem and mood were found not to be affected by the type, intensity or duration of the green exercise, as the results were similar for all 10 case studies. Thus all these activities generated mental health benefits, indicating the potential for a wider health and well-being dividend from green exercise.

However, their pathways are still understudied. This study investigates the mediating effects of physical and social activities (PA and SA) and functional ability (FA) in the relationships between BEs and late-life depression.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with data from 2,081 community-dwellers aged 65 years and older in Hong Kong in 2014. Two road-network-based service area buffers (200- and 500-m buffers) adjusted by terrain and slope from participants' residences were created to define the scope of neighborhoods. BEs comprised population density in District Council Constituency Areas, urban greenness, land-use diversity, and neighborhood facilities within 200- and 500-m buffers. Multilevel path analysis models were used.Results: More urban greenness within both buffers and more commercial facilities within a 500-m buffer were directly associated with fewer depressive symptoms. SA mediated the relationship between the number of community facilities and depressive symptoms within a 200-m buffer. Neighborhood urban greenness and the number of commercial facilities had indirect associations on depressive symptoms within a 500-m buffer, which were mediated by FA.Discussion: Our findings have implications for the ecological model of aging.

Different types of urban natural environments influence various dimensions of self-reported health,"Jarvis, I; Koehoorn, M; Gergel, SE; van den Bosch, M","Background: Growing evidence suggests health benefits of natural environments. Yet, the effects of different types of natural environments (vegetation and water features) and forms of human-nature contact (access versus exposure) remain relatively unexplored.Methods: A cross-sectional observational survey was used to analyse the relationship between both access and exposure to different types of urban natural environments and health outcomes in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Data for health outcomes (self-reported general health, mental health, and common mental disorders) and key confounders were obtained from the 2013-2014 Canadian Community Health Survey. Natural environments were quantified using local land use and land cover data, and linked to survey respondents by six-digit postal code. Access was defined as living within 300 m of a public greenspace (>= 1 hectare) and exposure as the percentage of different land cover types within multiple buffer distances of postal code centroids. Separate logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations of the access and exposure metrics with the three health outcomes.Results: Exposure to water within 1,000 m buffers was associated with a reduced odds of reporting poor general health (OR = 0.982, 95% CI = 0.965, 0.999). A similar association was found for exposure to shrub and grass-herb vegetation types for reported mental health and common mental disorder, respectively (OR = 0.741, 95% CI = 0.576, 0.953 for shrubs in 250 m; OR = 0.737, 95% CI = 0.577, 0.942 for shrubs in 500 m; OR = 0.731, 95% CI = 0.570, 0.938 for shrubs in 1,000 m; OR = 0.980, 95% CI = 0.965, 0.995 for grass-herbs in 250 m). Neither access to public greenspace nor aggregated greenspace exposure were associated with self-reported health. Results from stratified analyses suggest that observed associations between human-nature contact and self-reported health differ according to gender.Conclusions: Results suggest that type of natural environment should be considered in future research studying the health-promoting aspects of natural environments, and that positive health effects may be more consistent for daily life exposure than for access to public greenspace.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,186,,,WOS:000548186300122,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109614,,#944,Jarvis 2020,

Experimental studies have consistently found short term positive effects of physical activity in nature compared with built environments. This study explores whether these benefits are also evident in everyday life, perceived over repeated contact with nature. The topic is important from the perspectives of city planning, individual well-being, and public health. Methods: National survey data (n = 2,070) from Finland was analysed using structural regression analyses. Perceived general health, emotional well-being, and sleep quality were regressed on the weekly frequency of physical activity indoors, outdoors in built environments, and in nature. Socioeconomic factors and other plausible confounders were controlled for. Results: Emotional well-being showed the most consistent positive connection to physical activity in nature, whereas general health was positively associated with physical activity in both built and natural outdoor settings. Better sleep quality was weakly connected to frequent physical activity in nature, but the connection was outweighed by other factors. Conclusion: The results indicate that nature provides an added value to the known benefits of physical activity.

The Association between Residential Green Space in Childhood and Development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Population-Based Cohort Study,"Thygesen, M; Engemann, K; Holst, GJ; Hansen, B; Geels, C; Brandt, J; Pedersen, CB; Dalsgaard, S","BACKGROUND: Access to green space has been hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on children's mental well-being and cognitive development. The underlying mechanisms of the mental health benefits of green space are not fully understood, but different pathways have been suggested, such as the psychologically restoring capacities of green space, the ability to facilitate physical activity and social cohesion, and the mitigation of exposure to air pollution.OBJECTIVES: In this nationwide cohort study, we investigated associations between residential green space in early childhood and a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).METHODS: The cohort included individuals, who were born in Denmark between 1992 and 2007 (n = 814,689) and followed for a diagnosis of ADHD from age 5, during the period 1997-2016. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness surrounding each residential address in a quadratic area of 210 m x 210 m in which the residence was located in the center of the quadrate. Individual exposure to green space was calculated as the average of NDVI surrounding each individual's residential address (or addresses if more than one) between birth and the fifth birthday. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ADHD, according to exposure level and adjusted for calendar time, age, sex, parental socioeconomic status, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.RESULTS: Individuals living in areas defined by sparse green vegetation (lowest decile of NDVI) had an increased risk of developing ADHD, compared with individuals living in areas within the highest decile of NDVI (IRR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.65). Adjusting for the known confounders attenuated the result, but the association remained (IRR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lower levels of green space in residential surroundings, during early childhood, may be associated with a higher risk of developing ADHD.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,128,12,,WOS:000616373000013,10.1289/EHP6729,,#950,Thygesen 2020,

Residential greenness and risks of depression: Longitudinal associations with different greenness indicators and spatial scales in a Finnish population cohort,"Gonzales-Inca, C; Pentti, J; Stenholm, S; Suominen, S; Vahtera, J; Kayhko, N","We carried out a longitudinal study on the associations between residential greenness and depression risk in urban areas in Finland. Residential greenness indicators were estimated within various buffer sizes around individuals' home locations (selected n = 14424) using time-series of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and CORINE land cover data (CLC). We estimated individuals' cumulative exposure to residential greenness over a 5-years and 14-years follow-up. We used doctor-diagnosed depression and Beck Depression Inventory for depression assessment. Our multi-logistic model showed an inverse association between residential greenness and depression, implying lowered depression risk for individuals with higher residential greenness. The association was particularly evident when using NDVI-based residential greenness (within a buffer of 100 m radius) and doctor-diagnosis depression data, adjusted with individual-level covariates.

Not all types of nature have an equal effect on urban residents' well-being: A structural equation model approach,"Allard-Poesi, F; Matos, LBS; Massu, J","A growing amount of research shows a positive association between urban nature and urban residents' psychological and physical well-being and quality of life. With its focus on specific dimensions of well-being and reliance either on large-scale objective data sets or experimental and comparative designs, prior research does not explicitly address the relationships between the various types of urban nature as experienced by citizens and their overall well-being. The present research proposes a model for the potential influence of the perceptions of the type and characteristics of nature close to urban residences and citizens' well-being via their frequency of exposure to, and their activities in, nature. Using WHOQOL-26 as a measure of well-being and constructing or adapting measurements for the other variables, a questionnaire was designed and administered among a sample of 2500 French urban residents. Psychometric tests, structural equation modeling, and mediation analyses were conducted on the collected data. The results show that: (1) The perceived characteristics of nature near urban residences have both direct and indirect influences on the psychological, physical, environmental, and resources related dimensions of citizens' well-being; (2) Less domesticated nature-forests, fields, and scrubland-contributes to psychological well-being by favoring light or calm activities in nature, and to physical well-being by supporting exposure to nature. Such wilder nature is also positively associated with the perceived quality of urban residences; (3) Small spots of nature, located close to one's residence-a balcony, a patio, or a roof garden-make a similar but smaller contribution to well-being; (4) Domesticated nature-city gardens and parks-contribute marginally to the physical and resources-related dimensions of well-being. These results complement past research on the perceived characteristics of nature by showing how nature, as experienced by urban citizens, refers to different vegetation spaces.

Relationship of Design and Architectural Factors of Nursing Homes With the Mental Health of Their Residents,"Rakhshani, Z; Nastiezaie, N","Objectives Disregarding the quality of nursing homes can affect the mental health of older people living there. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the designing and architecture of nursing homes with the residents' mental health.Methods & Materials This research was descriptive-correlational. With purposeful sampling, we selected 158 elderly residents of the nursing homes of Shahriyar and Qods cities in Tehran Province. Then, we obtained the study data by two questionnaires of designing and architecture of nursing homes and mental health. To analyze the data, the Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis were used.Results The Mean +/- SD values of the study variables were as follows: light and brightness (22.93 +/- 4.96), public space (27.41 +/- 5.01), personal space (25.15 +/- 7.27), access space (28.62 +/- 3.69), green space (37.48 +/- 6.43), physical illnesses (16.47 +/- 2.99), anxiety and insomnia (16.51 +/- 3.99), social function disorder (12.13 +/- 2.72), and depression (16.39 +/- 3.08). The degree of correlation coefficients of designing and architecture and its components, i.e. light and brightness, public, personal, access and green spaces with the mental health of the elderly were -0.622, -0.328, -0.503, -0.404, -0.471, and -0.318, respectively (P<0.001). According to regression analysis, designing and architecture factors explain 40.2% of the mental health of older people (P<0.05).Conclusion It is hoped that relevant authorities recognize the importance of proper designing and architecture for nursing homes and by following the necessary standards improve the mental health of the older people living in nursing homes.",2019,,SALMAND-IRANIAN JOURNAL OF AGEING,14,3,342-354,WOS:000594127100008,10.32598/sija.13.10.460,,#968,Rakhshani 2019,
Why garden? - Attitudes and the perceived health benefits of home gardening,"Chalmin-Pui, LS; Griffiths, A; Roe, J; Heaton, T; Cameron, R","Domestic (home) gardens provide opportunities for psychological and physical health benefits, yet these environments have received less attention in terms of their therapeutic value compared to other urban green spaces. This is despite their ubiquity and the popularity of gardening as a pastime. This research explored why residents engaged with gardening and the extent to which they recognised any health benefits from the activity. A questionnaire was distributed electronically within the UK, with 5766 gardeners and 249 non-gardeners responding. Data were collated on factors including garden typology, frequency of gardening and individual perceptions of health and well-being. Significant associations were found between improvements in well-being, perceived stress and physical activity and more frequent gardening. Gardening on a frequent basis i.e. at least 2-3 times a week, corresponded with greatest perceived health benefits. Improving health, however, was not the prime motivator to garden, but rather the direct pleasure gardening brought to the participants. There was evidence that satisfaction with one's front garden and the time spent in it increased as the proportion of vegetation was enhanced. The data supports the notion that domestic gardens should be given greater prominence in urban planning debates, due to the role they play in providing health benefits.",2021,,CITIES,112,,,WOS:000634876500003,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103118,,#973,Chalmin-Pui 2021,

Visiting blue space regularly was more likely for those within a 10-15 min walk, and who believed visit locations had good facilities and wildlife present.

Assessing individual environmental exposure derived from the spatiotemporal behavior context and its impacts on mental health,"Zhang, L; Zhou, SH; Kwan, MP; Shen, MH","Research on the associations between environmental exposures and mental health has attracted considerable attention. Most studies to date have mainly estimated environmental health effects based on static geographic contexts (e.g., residential neighborhoods, administrative units), ignoring the dynamic nature of individual spatiotemporal behavior, which may lead to unreliable results. To address this limitation, this study collects survey data from 1003 adults in Guangzhou, China. Then, it delineates dynamic geographic context to capture individual daily activity and travel and assesses individual exposure to environmental factors derived from the home buffer (HB) and the time-weighted activity and travel buffer (TATB). Finally, multiple linear regression models are used in this paper to examine and compare the relationships between individual environmental exposure and mental health based on the HB and TATB. The results of this study indicate that there are great differences in individual environmental exposure levels based on the HB and TATB. The explanatory power of the environmental factors obtained from the TATB on mental health is greater than that derived from the HB. Specifically, exposures to some environmental factors (i.e., green space coverage, blue space coverage, fitness facility density, and recreational facility density) derived from the TATB have mental health-promoting effects, while exposures to the other environmental factors (i.e., public transit station density) have mental health constraining effects. These findings enrich our knowledge of spatiotemporal behavior and the effects of the dynamic contextual environment on mental health, as well as provide valuable implications for urban planning and public health service.",2021,,HEALTH & PLACE,71,,,WOS:000697054900005,10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102655,,#979,Zhang 2021,
"Blue space exposure, health and well-being: Does freshwater type matter?","McDougall, CW; Hanley, N; Quilliam, RS; Oliver, DM","There is growing evidence that spending time in or around water bodies or 'blue spaces' can result in improved human health. To date, investigations of the health-promoting potential of blue space exposure have mostly focused on coastal environments. Despite their vital role in many urban landscapes, freshwater blue spaces have received less research attention and very little is known about the potential of different freshwater blue space types to impact health and well-being. This study used logistic and negative binomial regression modelling to quantify the association between proximity and exposure to different freshwater blue space types and general health and mental well-being in Scotland. A nationwide online panel survey (n = 1392) was used to determine how far respondents lived from lakes, rivers and canals and to establish how often they visited these blue spaces. Living within a ten minute walking distance of lakes, rivers or canals was not associated with greater general health or mental well-being. However, frequently visiting rivers and canals but not lakes, in the last month, was associated with greater mental well-being. Frequent green space visitation, but not blue space visitation, was associated with higher odds of reporting good general health. Taken together, our findings suggest that freshwater blue space exposure can provide mental well-being benefits. However, the provision of these benefits may vary among different freshwater blue space types. Understanding the health and well-being impact of different freshwater environments, therefore, offers opportunities for evidence-based policymaking to maximise the health-promoting potential of urban blue spaces.",2022,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,224,,,WOS:000795006400002,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104446,,#980,McDougall 2022,

These included time spent in NOE (use); and perceived greenness, and satisfaction with and importance given to the NOE (experience). Physical activity, social contacts and mental health were selected as key outcome indicators. Descriptive and multilevel analyses were conducted both on pooled data and for individual cities.Results: More minutes spent in the NOE were associated with more minutes of physical activity, a higher frequency of social contacts with neighbors, and better mental well-being. Perceived greenness, satisfaction with and importance of the NOE, were other strong predictors of the outcomes, while GIS measures of NOE and streetscape quality were not.

However that analysis was based on cross-sectional data and was unable to control for potential selection effects (e.g. generally healthier, personality types moving to coastal locations). In the current study we have used English panel data to explore the relationship between the proximity to the coast and indicators of generic and mental health for the same individuals over time. This allowed us to control for both time-invariant factors such as personality and compare the strength of any relationship to that of other relationships (e.g. employment vs. unemployment). In support of cross-sectional analysis, individuals reported significantly better general health and mental health when living nearer the coast, controlling for both individual (e.g. employment status) and area (e.g. green space) level factors. No coastal effect on life satisfaction was found. Although individual level coastal proximity effects for general health and mental health were small, their cumulative impact at the community level may be meaningful for policy makers.

The effect of residential greenness and city park visiting habits on preschool Children's mental and general health in Lithuania: A cross-sectional study,"Andrusaityte, S; Grazuleviciene, R; Dedele, A; Balseviciene, B","Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the association between levels of residential surrounding greenness, preschool children's park use, sedentary behaviour, and mental and general health.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1489 4-6-year-old children - residents of Kaunas city, Lithuania. Responses to the questionnaires completed by parents were used to ascertain children's general and mental health. We estimated exposure to greenness by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and time spent in a park (i.e. park use). We used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent associations between health outcomes and surrounding greenness and time spent in the nearest city park, controlling for potential confounders.Results: Of all the studied children, 14% had poor perceived general health, and 44.7% spent 5 or more hours per week in city parks. A significant increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in children with poor health. Every additional hour of time spent in parks was associated with decreased sedentary behaviour and a lower risk of poor health; meanwhile, lower residential greenness was associated with poorer mental and general health. Compared with NDVI-100 m > median and park use exceeding 5 h per week, lower greenness exposure and shorter park usage were associated with the risk of poor health (adjusted odds ratio 2.32 (95% CI: 1.43, 3.78) and the general risk of mental difficulties (adjusted odds ratio 1.43 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.18) in 4-6-year-old children.Conclusions: Lower residential greenness levels and less time spent in a park were associated with poorer general and mental health among 4-6-year-old children.

Active commuting through natural environments is associated with better mental health: Results from the PHENOTYPE project,"Zijlema, WL; Avila-Palencia, I; Triguero-Mas, M; Gidlow, C; Maas, J; Kruize, H; Andrusaityte, S; Grazuleviciene, R; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ","] Background: Commuting routes with natural features could promote walking or cycling for commuting. Commuting through natural environments (NE) could have mental health benefits as exposure to NE can reduce stress and improve mental health, but there is little evidence. This study evaluates the association between NE and commuting, whether active or not, and the association between commuting (through NE), whether active or not, and mental health. We also evaluate the moderating effect of NE quality on the association between NE commuting and mental health.Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on adult respondents (n = 3599) of the Positive Health Effects of the Natural Outdoor Environment in Typical Populations in Different Regions in Europe (PHENOTYPE) project. Data were collected in four European cities in Spain, the Netherlands, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. Data on commuting behavior (active commuting at least one day/week, daily NE commuting) and mental health were collected with questionnaires. Associations were estimated with multilevel analyses including random intercepts at city- and neighborhood level.Results: Adjusted multilevel analyses showed that daily NE commuters were more often active commuters (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.19, 1.70). There was no association between active commuting and mental health, but daily NE commuters had on average a 2.74 (95% CI 1.66, 3.82) point higher mental health score than those not commuting through NE. The association with mental health was stronger among active commuters (4.03, 95% CI 2.13, 5.94) compared to non-active commuters (2.21; 95% CI 0.90, 3.51) when daily commuting through NE, but NE quality did not have a moderating effect.Conclusions: Daily NE commuting was associated with better mental health, especially for active commuters. Daily NE commuters were likely to be active commuters. Active commuting itself was not associated with mental health.

More green space is linked to less stress in deprived communities: Evidence from salivary cortisol patterns,"Thompson, CW; Roe, J; Aspinall, P; Mitchell, R; Clow, A; Miller, D","Green space has been associated with a wide range of health benefits, including stress reduction, but much pertinent evidence has relied on self-reported health indicators or experiments in artificially controlled environmental conditions. Little research has been reported using ecologically valid objective measures with participants in their everyday, residential settings. This paper describes the results of an exploratory study (n = 25) to establish whether salivary cortisol can act as a biomarker for variation in stress levels which may be associated with varying levels of exposure to green spaces, and whether recruitment and adherence to the required, unsupervised, salivary cortisol sampling protocol within the domestic setting could be achieved in a highly deprived urban population. Self-reported measures of stress and general wellbeing were also captured, allowing exploration of relationships between cortisol, wellbeing and exposure to green space close to home. Results indicate significant relationships between self-reported stress (P < 0.01), diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion (P < 0.05). and quantity of green space in the living environment. Regression analysis indicates percentage of green space in the living environment is a significant (P < 0.05) and independent predictor of the circadian cortisol cycle, in addition to self-reported physical activity (P < 0.02). Results also show that compliance with the study protocol was good. We conclude that salivary cortisol measurement offers considerable potential for exploring relationships between wellbeing and green space and discuss how this ecologically valid methodology can be developed to confirm and extend findings in deprived city areas to illuminate why provision of green space close to home might enhance health.

Age- and Sex-Specific Association Between Vegetation Cover and Mental Health Disorders: Bayesian Spatial Study,"Abdullah, AM; Law, J; Perlman, CM; Butt, ZA","Background: Despite growing evidence that reduced vegetation cover could be a putative risk factor for mental health disorders, the age-and the sex-specific association between vegetation and mental health disorder cases in urban areas is poorly understood. However, with rapid urbanization across the globe, there is an urgent need to study this association and understand the potential impact of vegetation loss on the mental well-being of urban residents. Objective: This study aims to analyze the spatial association between vegetation cover and the age-and sex-stratified mental health disorder cases in the neighborhoods of Toronto, Canada. Methods: We used remote sensing to detect urban vegetation and Bayesian spatial hierarchical modeling to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover and mental health disorder cases. Specifically, an Enhanced Vegetation Index was used to detect urban vegetation, and Bayesian Poisson lognormal models were implemented to study the association between vegetation and mental health disorder cases of males and females in the 0-19, 20-44, 45-64, and & GE;65 years age groups, after controlling for marginalization and unmeasured (latent) spatial and nonspatial covariates at the neighborhood level. Results: The results suggest that even after adjusting for marginalization, there were significant age-and sex-specific effects of vegetation on the prevalence of mental health disorders in Toronto. Mental health disorders were negatively associated with the vegetation cover for males aged 0-19 years (-7.009; 95% CI -13.130 to -0.980) and for both males (-4.544; 95% CI -8.224 to -0.895) and females (-3.513; 95% CI -6.289 to -0.681) aged 20-44 years. However, for older adults in the 45-64 and & GE;65 years age groups, only the marginalization covariates were significantly associated with mental health disorder cases. In addition, a substantial influence of the unmeasured (latent) and spatially structured covariates was detected in each model (relative contributions > 0.7), suggesting that the variations in area-specific relative risk were mainly spatial in nature. Conclusions: As significant and negative associations between vegetation and mental health disorder cases were found for young males and females, investments in urban greenery can help reduce the future burden of mental health disorders in Canada. The findings highlight the urgent need to understand the age-sex dynamics of the interaction between surrounding vegetation and urban dwellers and its subsequent impact on mental well-being.",2022,,JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE,8,7,,WOS:000839330700006,10.2196/34782,,#1898,Abdullah 2022,

Population-based studies are limited, however, and joint effects are rarely evaluated. We investigated associations of ADHD incidence with greenspace, air pollution, and noise in a population-based birth cohort.Methods: We assembled a cohort from administrative data of births from 2000 to 2001 (N similar to 37,000) in Metro Vancouver, Canada. ADHD was identified by hospital records, physician visits, and prescriptions. Cox propor-tional hazards models were applied to assess associations between environmental exposures and ADHD incidence adjusting for available covariates. Greenspace was estimated using vegetation percentage derived from linear spectral unmixing of Landsat imagery. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were esti-mated using land use regression models; noise was estimated using a deterministic model. Exposure period was from birth until the age of three. Joint effects of greenspace and PM2.5 were analysed in two-exposure models and by categorizing values into quintiles.Results: During seven-year follow-up, 1217 ADHD cases were diagnosed. Greenspace was associated with lower incidence of ADHD (hazard ratio, HR: 0.90 [0.81-0.99] per interquartile range increment), while PM2.5 was associated with increased incidence (HR: 1.11 [1.06-1.17] per interquartile range increment). NO2 (HR: 1.01 [0.96, 1.07]) and noise (HR: 1.00 [0.95, 1.05]) were not associated with ADHD. There was a 50% decrease in the HR for ADHD in locations with the lowest PM2.5 and highest greenspace exposure, compared to a 62% increase in HR in locations with the highest PM2.5 and lowest greenspace exposure.

Physiological and Psychological Effects of Nature Experiences in Different Forests on Young People,"Liu, QH; Wang, XP; Liu, JL; An, CY; Liu, YQ; Fan, XL; Hu, YS","Many studies have proved that having nature experiences in forests is conducive to human physiological and psychological health. However, currently there is little research focusing on the effects of forest characteristics and the experiential characteristics of nature experiences on changes in health. In the study, three types of forest (mixed forest; deciduous forest; coniferous forest) and an urban site were used to measure the effects of these environments on participants' physiological and psychological restoration after nature experience activities (sitting and walking activities). The study participants were 30 young adult students from Beijing Forestry University. Restorative effects were measured by physiological indicators (blood pressure and heart rate) and four psychological questionnaires (Profile of Mood States (POMS); Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS); Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS); Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)). Results demonstrated that all types of forest were beneficial to lower blood pressure and heart rate as well as to reduce negative feelings while boosting positive emotions. The mixed forest was more effective in lowering blood pressure and heart rate as well as increasing vitality. The levels of restoration and positive mental health increased significantly, while all subscales of the POMS (with the exception of vigor) decreased greatly in the coniferous forest. Relative to the sitting activity, obvious decreases in blood pressure and negative emotions were observed, while significant increases in restoration, vitality and positive mental health were observed after the walking activity. In conclusion, the impact on subjects' health restoration varied with different forest characteristics, and the experiential characteristics of exposure may be helpful for creating supportive interventions and lifting the benefits of forest therapy as people interact with the forest.",2021,,FORESTS,12,10,,WOS:000715333400001,10.3390/f12101391,,#1910,Liu 2021,

A total of 111 residents in Singapore completed a survey. Results from Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) and Pearson's correlation analyses show that, after controlling for age and levels of connection to nature, community gardeners reported significantly higher levels of subjective well-being than individual/home gardeners and non-gardeners, indicating that engagement in community gardening may be superior to individual/home gardening or non-gardening outdoor activities. Community gardeners reported higher levels of resilience and optimism than the non-gardening control group.

This study aims to examine the association of access to NOE (green and blue spaces) with each component of SWB (life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect), using cross-sectional study data collected in 23 neighbourhoods in Guangzhou, China. It particularly focuses on how different measures of access to NOE (streetscape metrics derived from Tencent street-view data and satellite derived metrics derived from land cover data) matter to relationships between NOE and SWB and the extent to which these relationships vary by individual socioeconomic status. Results from seemingly unrelated regressions (SURs) show that green view index and the amount of surrounding greenness are related to a lower level of negative affect, and blue view index and the amount of surrounding blueness are associated with more satisfaction with life. The amount of surrounding blueness is linked to a higher level of positive affect.

Participants ( N = 22) completed 30 -minutes of walking in both green and urban environments, with state anxiety assessed pre-, during-and post activity. Measures of expectations, attitudes to green exercise, and trait anxiety were recorded at baseline.

The association between natural outdoor environments and common somatic symptoms,"Watson, C; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ; Triguero-Mas, M; Cirach, M; Maas, J; Gidlow, C; Kruize, H; Andrusaityte, S; Grazuleviciene, R; Zijlema, WL","There is growing evidence that urban natural outdoor environments (NOE) may positively impact health by reducing stress and stress-related symptoms. However, there is limited research investigating this link across a range of NOE indicators. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between neighbourhood NOE (availability, use, and satisfaction with NOE) and common somatic symptoms and the role of potential mediators. Data were analysed from 3481 adults from Barcelona (Spain), Doetinchem (Netherlands), Kaunas (Lithuania) and Stoke-on-Trent (United Kingdom). NOE data were obtained through self-reported data and environmental measurements. Common somatic symptom data were self-reported. Mixed effects regression models were used for analysis, with models adjusted for potential sociodemographic confounders. Higher satisfaction with neighbourhood NOE was associated with lower prevalence of common somatic symptoms (exp(13) 0.97; 95% CI 0.96, 0.98); an association partially mediated by mental health, social cohesion and air quality concern. A longer time spent in NOE was associated with lower prevalence of common somatic symptoms in low socioeconomic status neighbourhoods (exp(13) 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 1.00). A higher number of neighbourhood green spaces (300m buffer) was associated with higher prevalence of common somatic symptoms (exp(13) 1.03; 95% CI 1.00, 1.05). No statistically significant associations were found for other NOE indicators. Study findings suggest that higher satisfaction with NOE may be associated with lower prevalence of common somatic symptoms, with mental health, social cohesion and concern about air quality playing partial mediating roles. Little evidence was found of an association between objective NOE measurements and common somatic symptoms, underlining the importance of perceptions of NOE for conferring health benefits.",2020,,HEALTH & PLACE,64,,,WOS:000562023800005,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102381,,#1933,Watson 2020,
Wetlands for Wellbeing: Piloting a Nature-Based Health Intervention for the Management of Anxiety and Depression,"Maund, PR; Irvine, KN; Reeves, J; Strong, E; Cromie, R; Dallimer, M; Davies, ZG","Nature-based health interventions (NBIs) for the treatment of poor mental health are becoming increasingly common, yet evidence to support their effectiveness is lacking. We conduct a pilot study of a six-week intervention, aiming to engage individuals with wetland nature for the treatment of anxiety and/or depression. We employed a mixed methods design, using questionnaires, focus groups and semi-structured interviews to evaluate the intervention from the perspective of participants (n = 16) and healthcare professionals (n = 2). Results demonstrate significant improvements in mental health across a range of indicators, including mental wellbeing (Warwick and Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and emotional wellbeing (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). Participants and healthcare professionals cited additional outcomes including improved physical health and reduced social isolation. The wetland site provided a sense of escape from participants' everyday environments, facilitating relaxation and reductions in stress. Wetland staff knowledge of the natural world, transportation and group organisation also played a considerable role in the intervention's success. These aspects should be considered in future and existing NBIs to maximise benefits to participants. We propose NBIs based in wetlands are an effective therapy option for individuals diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,22,,WOS:000502057400110,10.3390/ijerph16224413,,#1940,Maund 2019,

However, the potential impact of spatial accessibility to urban parks on older adults' mental health was under-researched, particularly in regard to various spatial scales and transport modes. Using linear mixed models, this study assessed the association between spatial accessibility to urban parks and two typical mental health issues of older adults (i.e. depression and anxiety) based on a mental health survey among 1,231 older adults in Beijing, China. Spatial accessibility of each community to parks via walking and public transport modes at local, regional, and global scales was calculated based on travel time by application programming interface of online map. Results show that the spatial accessibility of urban parks at all three scales and with different transport modes had a significant impact on older adults' anxiety; accessibility at the regional scale had the greatest impact. Older adults' depression was affected primarily by regional park accessibility in walking mode. Findings have important practical implications for spatial-accessibility improvements to urban parks and for constructing age-friendly urban spaces.",,,LEISURE STUDIES,,,,WOS:000825305900001,10.1080/02614367.2022.2094994,,#1943,,
Evaluating the Mental-Health Positive Impacts of Agritourism; A Case Study from South Korea,"Rezaei, M; Kim, D; Alizadeh, A; Rokni, L","The stressful lifestyle of urban dwellers has increased the demand for green-based leisure activities; considering such growing demand, this paper investigated the potential mental health benefits of agritourism activities. The assessments were based on a questionnaire survey of two groups: visitors of agritourism sites around Seoul and a control group staying home (n = 200). In addition to measuring the participants' well-being level and stress level, they were also asked to self-estimate their immediate mood after their activities of the day. The analysis was conducted with R version 4.1.0 to explore the potential relationships and interactions between the activity of the day, perceived psychological factors, and the immediate emotional outcomes. Findings reveal that visitors to the agritourism sites perceived considerable improvement in their immediate mood compared to the control group who stayed home. Results indicate a significant interaction between self-reported wellbeing and agritourism activities and a combined effect on improved mood. Therefore, agritourism can potentially be a resource for a positive mood boost and improved mental health. The suggested practical implications can be applied as strategies to evoke the feeling of more connection to the agritourism activities and raise awareness of potential mental health outcomes.",2021,,SUSTAINABILITY,13,16,,WOS:000690275100001,10.3390/su13168712,,#1950,Rezaei 2021,

Seventy-seven participants visited three different types of urban areas; a built-up city centre (as a control environment), an urban park, and urban woodland located in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Our results show that the large urban park and extensively managed urban woodland had almost the same positive influence, but the overall perceived restorativeness was higher in the woodland after the experiment. The findings suggest that even short-term visits to nature areas have positive effects on perceived stress relief compared to built-up environment. The salivary cortisol level decreased in a similar fashion in all three urban environments during the experiment.

Can't see the wood for the trees? An assessment of street view- and satellite-derived greenness measures in relation to mental health,"Helbich, M; Poppe, R; Oberski, D; Van Emmichoven, MZ; Schram, R","Greenness in the urban living environment is inconsistently associated with mental health. Satellite-derived measures of greenness may inadequately characterize how people encounter greenness visually on site, but systematic comparisons are lacking. We aimed 1) to compare associations between remotely sensed and street view (SV) greenness, and 2) to examine whether these greenness metrics are differently associated with mental health outcomes. We used cross-sectional depressive and anxiety symptoms data on adults in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We employed a convolutional neural network to segment greenness in SV panoramas. Greenness was measured top-down by normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from 1 m resolution orthophotos (OP) and 30 m resolution Landsat-8 (LS) imagery per postal code, and 100 and 300 m concentric and streetnetwork buffers at the home address. Correlation analyses assessed associations across greenness measures. Covariate-adjusted regressions (e.g., noise, air pollution, deprivation) were conducted to assess associations between each greenness metric and mental health outcomes. Correlations between greenness metrics were significantly positive and moderately high. SV greenness was less sensitive across scales and residential contexts than OP and LS greenness. There was no statistically significant evidence that people with less urban residential greenness had higher depression or anxiety scores than those exposed to higher levels. Nor did different greenness measures, scales, or residential context definitions alter our null associations. This suggests that even though SV and remotely sensed measures capture different aspects of greenness, these differences across exposure metrics did not translate into an association with mental health outcomes.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,214,,,WOS:000681114000001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104181,,#1954,Helbich 2021,

The importance of ecological quality of public green and blue spaces for subjective well-being,"Knight, SJ; McClean, CJ; White, PCL","There is now considerable evidence that the natural environment provides health and well-being benefits in urban environments. However, little is understood about the role of ecological quality in maximising well-being gains. We examine the relationship between the accessibility of public natural spaces of high ecological quality and two measures of subjective well-being for adults, using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), a large, longitudinal panel dataset. We then compare this relationship with that found with all Public Open Spaces, regardless of their ecological quality. We use the designation of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) as an objective indication of high-quality green-or bluespace, and life satisfaction and mental distress as measures of well-being. We use the Areas of Deficiency dataset from Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL) to identify residential areas with more than a 1 km walk from a SINC, based on actual walking routes from known access points. Postcode-level analysis using regression modelling reveals that living beyond a 1 km walk of a SINC decreases an individual's life satisfaction by 0.117 points on a scale of 1 to 7. No relationship is found for mental distress. We also do not find any significant relationship between either well-being measure and all Public Open Spaces.

Most examined neighbourhood attributes were not associated with QoL in the whole sample. Neighbourhood residential and entertainment density was curvilinearly and/or linearly related to specific QoL domains. Number of parks was negatively associated with social QoL and having well-treed parks with higher levels of social QoL. Older adults living alone in neighbourhoods with poor access to destinations and few activities in parks showed lower environmental and/or social QoL than their counterparts. Neighbourhood built environment characteristics do not seem to impact Hong Kong older adults' physical and psychological QoL.

A room with a green view: the importance of nearby nature for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Soga, M; Evans, MJ; Tsuchiya, K; Fukano, Y","The COVID-19 pandemic and its global response have resulted in unprecedented and rapid changes to most people's day-to-day lives. To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing (""social distancing""), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 3,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a ""nature-based solution"" for improved public health.",2021,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,31,2,,WOS:000589903000001,10.1002/eap.2248,,#2001,Soga 2021,
Mental Health Outcomes in Barcelona: The Interplay between Gentrification and Greenspace,"Zayas-Costa, M; Cole, HVS; Anguelovski, I; Connolly, JJT; Bartoll, X; Triguero-Mas, M","Greenspace is widely related to mental health benefits, but this relationship may vary by social group. Gentrification, as linked to processes of unequal urban development and conflict, potentially impacts health outcomes. This study explores the relationships between greenspace and mental health and between gentrification and mental health associations. It also further examines gentrification as an effect modifier in the greenspace-mental health association and SES as an effect modifier in the gentrification-mental health association. We used cross-sectional Barcelona (Spain) data from 2006, which included perceived mental health status and self-reported depression/anxiety from the Barcelona Health Survey. Greenspace exposure was measured as residential access to (1) all greenspace, (2) greenways and (3) parks in 2006. Census-tract level gentrification was measured using an index including changes in sociodemographic indicators between 1991 and 2006. Logistic regression models revealed that only greenways were associated with better mental health outcomes, with no significant relationship between mental health and parks or all greenspace. Living in gentrifying neighborhoods was protective for depression/anxiety compared to living in non-gentrifying neighborhoods. However, only residents of gentrifiable census tracts benefited from the exposure to greenways. SES was not found to be an effect modifier in the association between gentrification and mental health. Future research should tackle this study's limitations by incorporating a direct measure of displacement in the gentrification status indicator, accounting for qualitative aspects of greenspace and user's perceptions.

Controlling for demographic and visit characteristics we found that of the broad environmental categories, coastal visits were associated with the most restoration and town and urban parks with the least. In terms of specific environmental types two ""green space"" locations (woodlands/forests and hills/moorland/mountains) were associated with levels of restoration comparable to coastal locations. Urban playing fields were associated with the least restoration. Restoration was positively associated with visit duration (a potential dose-response effect), and visits with children were associated with less restoration than visits alone. There was little evidence that different activities (e.g. walking, exercising) were associated with differences in restoration.

Prenatal greenspace exposure and cord blood cortisol levels: A cross-sectional study in a middle-income country,"Boll, LM; Khamirchi, R; Alonso, L; Llurba, E; Pozo, OJ; Miri, M; Dadvand, P","Exposure to greenspace has been associated with reduced stress; however, the available evidence on such an association for the fetus is still very scarce. We, for the first time, investigated the association between maternal greenspace exposure and the level of cortisol, a stress hormone, in the cord blood. Our study was based on a cohort of 150 pregnant women in Sabzevar, Iran (2018). We comprehensively assessed greenspace exposure for each participant through (i) residential surrounding greenspace (using two satellite-derived vegetation indices), (ii) residential proximity to green spaces, (iii) maternal visual access to greenspace, (iv) use of public and private green spaces, (v) having a private garden, and (vi) the number of plant pots at home. Linear regression models were developed to assess the association of each indicator of greenspace exposure with cord blood cortisol levels, controlled for the relevant covariates. We observed that a higher residential surrounding greenspace (100 m buffer), having a window with greenspace view, window greenspace coverage of more than 50%, frequently looking at greenspace through window, residential proximity to large green spaces, and more time spent in green spaces were associated with lower cortisol levels in the cord blood. The findings for residential surrounding greenspace at 300 m and 500 m buffers, residential proximity to any green space regardless of its size, having a private garden, and number of plant pots at home were not conclusive. While about one-third of the association between residential surrounding greenspace (100 m buffer) could be mediated through reduction in exposure to air pollution, we did not observe any strong evidence for such a mediatory role for the visual access to greenspace.

SPIRITUAL CARE OF CANCER PATIENTS BY INTEGRATED MEDICINE IN URBAN GREEN SPACE: A PILOT STUDY,"Nakau, M; Imanishi, J; Watanabe, S; Imanishi, A; Baba, T; Hirai, K; Ito, T; Chiba, W; Morimoto, Y","Background: Psycho-oncological care, including spiritual care, is essential for cancer patients. Integrated medicine, a therapy combining modern western medicine with various kinds of complementary and alternative medicine, can be appropriate for the spiritual care of cancer because of the multidimensional characteristics of the spirituality. In particular, therapies that enable patients to establish a deeper contact with nature, inspire feelings of life and growth of plants, and involve meditation may be useful for spiritual care as well as related aspects such as emotion. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of spiritual care of cancer patients by integrated medicine in a green environment.Methods: The present study involved 22 cancer patients. Integrated medicine consisted of forest therapy, horticultural therapy, yoga meditation, and support group therapy, and sessions were conducted once a week for 12 weeks. The spirituality (the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being), quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire), fatigue (Cancer Fatigue Scale), psychological state (Profile of Mood States, short form, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and natural killer cell activity were assessed before and after intervention.Results: In Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being, there were significant differences in functional well-being and spiritual well-being pre- and postintervention.

Using a cross-over experimental design; this pilot study investigated the effect of four urban environments on physiological and psychological stress measures. Participants (N = 15) were exposed on separate days to one of the four settings for 20 min. These settings were designated as Very Natural; Mostly Natural; Mostly Built and Very Built. Visitation order to the four settings was individually randomized. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase; as well as self-report measures of stress; were collected before and after exposure to each setting. Gender was included as a variable in analysis; and additional data about environmental self-identity, pre-existing stress, and perceived restorativeness of settings were collected as measures of covariance. Differences between environmental settings showed greater benefit from exposure to natural settings relative to built settings; as measured by pre-to-post changes in salivary amylase and self-reported stress; differences were more significant for females than for males. Inclusion of covariates in a regression analysis demonstrated significant predictive value of perceived restorativeness on these stress measures, suggesting some potential level of mediation. These data suggest that exposure to natural environments may warrant further investigation as a health promotion method for reducing stress.",2013,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,10,4,1250-1267,WOS:000318032300006,10.3390/ijerph10041250,,#2030,Beil 2013,
"The Effects of Green and Urban Walking in Different Time Frames on Physio-Psychological Responses of Middle-Aged and Older People in Chengdu, China","Li, HS; Liu, HW; Yang, ZQ; Bi, SL; Cao, Y; Zhang, GD","Nighttime walking is becoming a popular exercise for many middle-aged and older people in Asian countries. However, the health benefits of nighttime walking in urban areas and green spaces are still unclear. This study evaluated the physiological and psychological responses of 48 middle-aged and older people who walked 1.6 km through a green space and an urban area during daytime and nighttime. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), and Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS) were employed to measure the psychological responses, and pulse rate and blood pressure (SBP, DBP and MAP) were measured to evaluate the physiological responses. The results showed that the daytime green walking induced psychological improvements and lowered blood pressure (p < 0.05), while the daytime urban walking resulted in slight deterioration of all the measured parameters (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the nighttime green walking induced lowered blood pressure (p < 0.05), whilst the nighttime urban walking resulted in psychological improvements and lowered blood pressure (p < 0.05), and no significant difference was found in any measured parameter between the two nighttime walking groups. In conclusion, urban areas are noisy and irritating in the daytime, and not suitable for walking, but may become pleasurable and attractive at night. The psychological benefits of green walking may decrease at night, and nighttime walking in either an urban area or a green space may achieve similar health benefits. Therefore, we recommend that urban citizens start nighttime walking in a green space or an urban area to keep fit when the air is less polluted.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,1,,WOS:000606056000001,10.3390/ijerph18010090,,#2037,Li 2021,
Proximity to Urban Parks and Mental Health,"Sturm, R; Cohen, D","Background: Urban parks have received attention in recent years as a possible environmental factor that could encourage physical activity, prevent obesity, and reduce the incidence of chronic conditions. Despite long hypothesized benefits of parks for mental health, few park studies incorporate mental health measures.Aims of the Study: To test the association between proximity to urban parks and psychological distress.Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of individual health survey responses. Data were collected for a study of capital improvements of neighborhood parks in Los Angeles. A survey was fielded on a sample of residential addresses, stratified by distance from the park (within 400m, 800m, 1.6 km, and 3.2km; N=1070). We used multiple regression to estimate the relationship between the psychological distress as measured by the MHI-5 (outcome variable) and distance to parks (main explanatory variable), controlling for observed individual characteristics.Results: Mental health is significantly related to residential distance from parks, with the highest MHI-5 scores among residents within short walking distance from the park (400m) and decreasing significantly over the next distances. The number of visits and physical activity minutes are significantly and independently related to distance, although controlling for them does not reduce the association between distance and mental health.Discussion and Limitations: This paper provides a new data point for an arguably very old question, but for which empirical data are sparse for the US. A nearby urban park is associated with the same mental health benefits as decreasing local unemployment rates by 2 percentage points, suggesting at least the potential of environmental interventions to improve mental health. The analysis is cross-sectional, making it impossible to control for important confounders, including residential selection.Implications for Health Policy: Mental health policy has traditionally focused on individual-centered interventions. Just as health policy for preventable chronic illnesses has shifted attention to modifiable environmental determinants, population mental health may benefit substantially from environmental interventions.Implications for Future Research: Policy evaluations should incorporate mental health measures when assessing neighborhood improvement programs and physical environments. Many recent and ongoing studies have excluded mental health measure in the belief that they are too burdensome for respondents or irrelevant. If a causal relationship is confirmed, then ameliorating neighborhood conditions and physical environments could represent a scalable way to improve mental health issues for large populations.",2014,,JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS,17,1,19-24,WOS:000333140000004,,,#2039,Sturm 2014,
Health Benefits from Nature Experiences Depend on Dose,"Shanahan, DF; Bush, R; Gaston, KJ; Lin, BB; Dean, J; Barber, E; Fuller, RA","Nature within cities will have a central role in helping address key global public health challenges associated with urbanization. However, there is almost no guidance on how much or how frequently people need to engage with nature, and what types or characteristics of nature need to be incorporated in cities for the best health outcomes. Here we use a nature dose framework to examine the associations between the duration, frequency and intensity of exposure to nature and health in an urban population. We show that people who made long visits to green spaces had lower rates of depression and high blood pressure, and those who visited more frequently had greater social cohesion. Higher levels of physical activity were linked to both duration and frequency of green space visits. A dose-response analysis for depression and high blood pressure suggest that visits to outdoor green spaces of 30 minutes or more during the course of a week could reduce the population prevalence of these illnesses by up to 7% and 9% respectively. Given that the societal costs of depression alone in Australia are estimated at AUD$12.6 billion per annum, savings to public health budgets across all health outcomes could be immense.",2016,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,6,,,WOS:000378325500001,10.1038/srep28551,,#2040,Shanahan 2016,
Exercise in the Park or Gym? The Physiological and Mental Responses of Obese People Walking in Different Settings at Different Speeds: A Parallel Group Randomized Trial,"Wang, XX; Zhou, QF; Zhang, MJ; Zhang, QH","Evidence shows that physical activity has multiple health benefits for the body and mind of oneself, but little is known about the impacts of the setting and the intensity on exercise experience, especially for obese people. This study investigated the physiological and psychological effects of four walking conditions with different settings (park vs. gym) and intensity (slow vs. fast) on young obese adults. Subjects were 18-21 years old Chinese university students (N = 77), who were diagnosed as obese. They were randomly assigned to participate in one of the four activities in the field: slow walk in the park (2.8 km/h), fast walk in the park (5.5 km/h), slow walk in the gym, and fast walk in the gym. Physiological indices, including blood pressure and heart rate, were measured before and after the walk. Psychological responses were measured by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the mood states scale, and the semantic differential scale. This study of obese people aged 18-21 years confirmed the previous findings that exercising in natural environments better relieved stress and restored attentional level than indoor activities. The results suggested that the mood states of the participants and their environmental perceptions may be influenced by the walking conditions with different setting and speed. The findings can be used in planning and designing urban green spaces for promoting physical activity and making exercise plans for obese people.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,12,,,WOS:000716470600001,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.728826,,#2052,Wang 2021,
Comparison of place attachment influence on the level of happiness of people living near residential parks,"IOP; Nurhakim, I; Kurniawan, EB; Wardhani, DK","Several studies have shown that living close to a park is associated with high levels of happiness. However, there is a possible difference in the level of happiness between living close to a park (0-400 meters radius) compared to living far from the park (400-1.000 meters radius). Therefore, this study aims to compare the influence of Place Attachment on the level of happiness for people living near a park, especially residential parks in some housing areas in Malang City. Place Attachment in this study defined as a bond between an individual and a particular setting. The study demonstrates a positive influence of Place Attachment on the level of happiness of people living near the park. Respondents who live close to a park (R = 0.441; Happiness Level = 97.8%; Average Happiness = 6.833) tend to have a higher level of happiness compared to respondents who live far from a park (R = 0.326; Happiness Level = 69.9%; average Happiness = 4.148).

Are public open space attributes associated with walking and depression?,"Koohsari, MJ; Badland, H; Mavoa, S; Villanueva, K; Francis, J; Hooper, P; Owen, N; Giles-Corti, B","Public open spaces (POS) are key neighbourhood destinations shown to confer numerous physical and mental health benefits. The amount and spatial distribution of POS throughout cities are guided by urban planning policies and standards. However, empirical evidence is not generally used to create POS standards. Developing and testing POS indices associated with positive health outcomes, can inform evidence-based POS urban design and planning standards that support the creation of healthier cities. This study examined associations of urban design policy-derived and empirical measures of POS proximity and density with walking and depression. The 2011-12 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study (AusDiab) wave data were used. Adults living in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia were included (n = 319). Participants reported walking for recreation and any walking within their neighbourhood during the last week. Depression was calculated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD-10). Informed by Australian urban design policies and empirical evidence, various POS measures were calculated at different street network distances around residential addresses using geographic information systems software. Measures tested included: distance to nearest POS, size of nearest POS, total number of POS, and area of POS at scales of 400, 800, 1000, and 1600 m. Associations of these POS measures with walking and depression were examined using adjusted multilevel logistic regression models. Overall 68% and 77% of participants reported walking for recreation and any walking in the past week, respectively; and about 13% were categorized as depressed. Living within 400 m of POS was not associated with either type of walking, but those whose nearest POS was > 1.5 ha had 1.90 and 2.66 times greater odds of walking for recreation and any walking during the last week, respectively. In Melbourne, the urban design policy standard is that POS be available within 400 m of homes. In our study, this standard was not associated with walking or depression; however having a larger POS nearby supported residents' walking. This study highlights the importance of assessing such standards for their potential health impact, and warrants further investigation.",2018,,CITIES,74,,119-125,WOS:000425561800012,10.1016/j.cities.2017.11.011,,#2076,Koohsari 2018,
Association of urban built environment and socioeconomic factors with suicide mortality in high-density cities: A case study of Hong Kong,"Wang, P; Goggins, WB; Zhang, XY; Ren, C; Lau, KKL","Population ageing, climate change and urbanization have been occurring rapidly globally. Evidence-based healthy city development is required to improve living quality and mitigate the adverse impact of city living on both physical and mental health. We took a high-density city as an example to explore the association of built environment and suicide mortality and preferably to offer some implications for better future city development. Poisson generalized linear models with generalized estimation equations were employed to regress suicide mortality rate on four urban built environment variables (frontal area density (FAD), sky view factor (SVF), ground coverage ratio (GCR), and street coverage ratio (SCR)), as well as socioeconomic factors, population density, and greenery. The association for different causes of death and within different subgroups was also investigated. Generally, higher FAD and GCR were associated with higher suicide mortality while higher SVF and SCR were associated with lower suicide mortality. Age was a significant effect modifier. An interquartile range increase in FAD, SVF, and GCR was associated with 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.92), 1.41 (95% CI 1.04-1.91), and 0.70 (95% CI 0.50-0.98) times the risk of suicide among the people aged over 70, respectively. Higher population density and unmarried status were generally associated with higher suicide rate whereas higher education level was associated with a decreased risk. Unfavorable built environment could increase risks for successful suicide attempts. Better urban development with morphological control mitigating intensifying urban heat island and other micro-environment changes are warranted to promote not only physical but psychological health.

"A population-based retrospective study of the modifying effect of urban blue space on the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on mental health, 2009-2018","Georgiou, M; Tieges, Z; Morison, G; Smith, N; Chastin, S","The incidence of mental health disorders in urban areas is increasing and there is a growing interest in using urban blue spaces (urban waterways, canals, lakes, ponds, coasts, etc.) as a tool to manage and mitigate mental health inequalities in the population. However, there is a dearth of longitudinal evidence of the mechanisms and impact of blue spaces on clinical markers of mental health to support and inform such interventions. We conducted a 10-year retrospective study, following STROBE guidelines, using routinely collected population primary care health data within the National Health Service (NHS) administrative area of Greater Glasgow and Clyde for the North of Glasgow city area. We explored whether living near blue space modifies the negative effect of socio-economic deprivation on mental health during the regeneration of an urban blue space (canal) from complete dereliction and closure. A total of 132,788 people (65,351 female) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were entered in the analysis. We established a base model estimating the effect of deprivation on the risk of mental health disorders using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, sex and pre-existing comorbidities. We then investigated the modifying effect of living near blue space by computing a second model which included distance to blue space as an additional predicting variable and compared the results to the base model. Living near blue space modified the risk of mental health disorders deriving from socio-economic deprivation by 6% (hazard ratio 2.48, 95% confidence interval 2.39-2.57) for those living in the most deprived tertile (T1) and by 4% (hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.60-1.72) for those in the medium deprivation tertile (T2).

"Green spaces and cognitive development at age 7 years in a rome birth cohort: The mediating role of nitrogen dioxide*,**","Asta, F; Michelozzi, P; Cesaroni, G; De Sario, M; Davoli, M; Porta, D","Introduction There is evidence of improvement on mental health and well-being due to contact with green spaces, through various mechanisms and with potentially differential impacts in different populations. Many of these studies have been conducted among adults, while children have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between residential exposure to greenness and cognitive development at age 7 and to evaluate nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a potential mediator of this association.Methods This longitudinal study was based on a cohort of newborns enrolled at delivery in two large obstetric hospitals in Rome. We assessed cognitive development at 7 years of age through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III edition (WISC-III). We estimated residential surrounding greenness, using satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), within 300m and 500m buffers around each residential address at birth. We applied weighted multiple linear regression analyses to study the association between NDVI and the WISC-III cognitive scores, using the inverse probability weighting methodology to correct for potential selection bias. We performed a mediation analysis to evaluate the mediating role of NO2 in the association under study.Results We enrolled 719 children at birth and performed our analyses only on 465 children with data on exposure and outcome. The results were not consistent for the average residential surrounding greenness in 300m buffer. For an IQR increase in greenness within 500m buffer around home addresses at birth we found a progress in Arithmetic subtest (?:0.39; 90% CI: 0.11?0.6), a test concerning with attention, concentration and numerical reasoning, apart from an indication of the positive association with Full scale IQ and Verbal IQ. This association was partly mediated by reduction in NO2, since adding this pollutant in our model explained 35% (90% CI: 7%?62%) of our estimate. Conclusions Our findings showed an association between residential surrounding greenness within 500m and better scores on attention tests at 7 years of age. The observed association between Arithmetic subtest and NDVI was mediated, in part, by a reduction in NO2.

Longitudinal effects of physical and social neighbourhood change on suicide mortality: A full population cohort study among movers and non-movers in the Netherlands,"Hagedoorn, P; Helbich, M","Associations between the residential neighbourhood environment and suicide mortality are well-established; however, most evidence is cross-sectional and not capable of incorporating place-based and residential moving-related neighbourhood changes. We studied how suicide mortality is associated with changes in the physical and social neighbourhood environment for movers and non-movers. Our retrospective analysis was based on longitudinal register data for the entire Dutch population aged 25-64 years enriched with annually time-varying data on the residential neighbourhood environment between 2007 and 2016. A total of 8,741,021 people were followed-up between 2007 and 2016 of which 10,019 committed suicide. Upward and downward neighbourhood change was measured by comparing neighbourhood conditions separately at two time points. Cox proportional hazard models indicated that movers had a significantly lower risk of suicide compared to non movers. Suicide risk was lower for people experiencing improvements in social fragmentation and deprivation compared to those remaining in poor conditions. Change from rural to urban conditions also resulted in lower suicide risk, while a gain in green space put people at increased risk. For those stable neighbourhood conditions over time, suicide mortality was lower for men and women in urban vs. rural neighbourhoods as well as for women in neighbourhoods with low vs. high social fragmentation. Stable exposure to high levels of green space resulted in higher suicide risk among women. Interactions and stratification by moving type revealed associations between neighbourhood change and suicide were more pronounced in non-movers. Our findings suggest that neighbourhood improvements might contribute to a lower suicide risk, especially for long-term residents in poor neighbourhood conditions.",2022,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,294,,,WOS:000800446600007,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114690,,#2110,Hagedoorn 2022,
"Multiple Pathways: The Influence Mechanism of Greenspace Exposure on Mental Health-A Case Study of Hangzhou, China","Lu, JC; Luo, XL; Yang, NN; Shen, Y","Greenspace exposure (GSE) may have a positive impact on mental health. However, existing research lacks a classification analysis of the influence pathways of different GSE on mental health. Meanwhile, the research method is limited to the measurement of the green space ratio (GSR) based on remote sensing data, which ignores people's real perception of greenspace. This paper aims to further expand the measurement method of GSE, taking Hangzhou, China as an example, and to reveal the influence mechanism of different GSE modes on mental health. We obtained the personal information, mental health, physical activity, and other data of the interviewees through a questionnaire (n = 461). Combined with a remote sensing satellite and the Baidu Street view database, the method of image interpretation and deep learning was used to obtain the GSR, green visual ratio (GVR), and green visual exposure (GVE). The structural equation model is used to analyze the relationship between different variables. The results showed that: (1) GSE has a certain positive effect on mental health; (2) there are differences in the influence mechanism of multiple measures of GSE on mental health-the GVR and GVE measures based on the interaction perspective between human and greenspace make the influence mechanism more complicated, and produce direct and indirect influence paths; and (3) greenspace perception, sense of community, and physical activity can act as mediators, and have indirect effects. Finally, we call for expanding the measurement index and methods of GSE and integrating them into the management and control practices of urban planning to promote the healthy development of communities and even cities.",2021,,LAND,10,4,,WOS:000643254400001,10.3390/land10040339,,#2114,Lu 2021,

Associations between Greenspaces and Individual Health: A Longitudinal Study in China,"Liao, LP; Du, MZ","Using a longitudinal survey in China, this study identifies the effect of greenspaces on individual health in the aspects of self-rated health, mental health, feeling physical discomfort, and being hospitalized. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to measure the greenery cover of each city, and findings show that higher NDVI leads to the improvement of personal self-rated health status, and it also decreases the probability of being hospitalized, having symptoms of physical discomfort, and being lost in bad mood. The positive health effect of NDVI in the city is much more significant and larger for the middle-aged, the elderly, and the low-educated. The evidence of the three possible channels through which the NDVI of each city shows a positive correlation with individual physical and mental health is found. The increased NDVI in the city encourages residents to foster healthier habits (e.g., decreasing smoking or drinking, increasing sleeping hours), improves air quality and reduces air pollution in each city, and promotes the social cohesion of people, and so the health status of residents is enhanced.

"Biodiversity, environmental health and human well-being: analysis of linkages and pathways","Adjei, POW; Agyei, FK","Well-being, a condition of positive physical, social and mental state of life, has become a prime focus of research in recent years as people seek to achieve and sustain it. Interacting with the natural environment has been established as a way of acquiring well-being benefits. However, the extent to which well-being depends on various aspects of the environment particularly biodiversity has received less attention. This paper examines the relationship between the level of biodiversity in an environment and human well-being. The depression and happiness scale was employed to sample 236 visitors of eight green spaces in Anglesey and Gwynedd, North Wales, while also noting socio-demographic and environmental factors such as perceived naturalness, density of visitors and noise level to establish the relationship. In each green space, the levels of native and introduced plant diversity were estimated. The paper established that level of ecological diversity determines level of people's wellness and happiness derived from a green environment. Visitors to green spaces with higher plant diversity receive higher levels of happiness. Significantly too, diversity of introduced species was a better predictor than native plant diversity.

Does greenery experienced indoors and outdoors provide an escape and support mental health during the COVID-19 quarantine?,"Dzhambov, AM; Lercher, P; Browning, MHEM; Stoyanov, D; Petrova, N; Novakov, S; Dimitrova, DD","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed people?s ability to recreate in public green spaces, which is likely to exacerbate the psychological impacts of the pandemic. In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment.Methods: Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99 ? 3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the ?being away? dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the ?being away? and ?fascination? dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables.Results: Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health.Conclusions: Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,196,,,WOS:000649627200010,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110420,,#2132,Dzhambov 2021,
Disentangling how the built environment relates to children's well-being: Participation in leisure activities as a mediating pathway among 8-year--olds based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study,"Nordbo, ECA; Raanaas, RK; Nordh, H; Aamodt, G","There is scarce insight into the role of the built environment for children's subjective well-being. In an attempt to increase our knowledge on this matter, we conducted a cross-sectional study comprising 23,043 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Information about children's leisure activities and their moods and feelings were linked to geospatial data on green space, facilities and population density to assess whether these built characteristics are related to subjective well-being and if participating in leisure activities is a mediator in such relations. We found that children having a park and more playgrounds/sports fields in the neighborhood, as well as those living in more densely populated areas, had more depressive moods and negative feelings. However, participating in leisure-time physical activity, organized activities and social activity with friends mediated these relations and contributed to counterbalancing some of the negative associations observed. The findings suggest that planners and policy makers should focus on ensuring children have neighborhood resources and venues that could support engagement in leisure activities that add positive experiences for their subjective well-being.",2020,,HEALTH & PLACE,64,,,WOS:000562023700010,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102360,,#2138,Nordbo 2020,

The impact of urbanisation on nature dose and the implications for human health,"Cox, DTC; Shanahan, DF; Hudson, HL; Fuller, RA; Gaston, KJ","The last 100 years have seen a huge change in the global structure of the human population, with the majority of people now living in urban rather than rural environments. An assumed consequence is that people will have fewer experiences of nature, and this could have important consequences given the myriad health benefits that they can gain from such experiences. Alternatively, as experiences of nature become rarer, people might be more likely actively to seek them out, mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation. In this study, we used data for 3000 survey respondents from across the UK, and a nature-dose framework, to determine whether (a) increasing urbanisation is associated with a decrease in the frequency, duration and intensity of nature dose; and (b) differences in nature exposure associated with urbanisation impact on four population health outcomes (depression, self-reported health, social cohesion and physical activity). We found negative exponential relationships between nature dose and the degree of urbanisation. The frequency and duration of dose decreased from rural to suburban environments, followed by little change with further increases in urbanisation. There were weak but positive associations between frequency and duration of dose across all four health domains, while different dimensions of dose showed more positive associations with specific health domains in towns and cities. We show that people in urban areas with a low nature dose tend to have worse health across multiple domains, but have the potential for the greatest gains from spending longer in nature, or living in green areas.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,179,,72-80,WOS:000444927200007,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.013,,#2147,Cox 2018,
The impact of the physical and urban environment on mental well-being,"Guite, HF; Clark, C; Ackrill, G","Objectives: To examine the strength of association between physical and social factors in the built environment and mental well-being, and to determine which factors are the most important.Study Design: A postal survey based on a theoretical model of domains that might link the physical and urban environment with mental well-being was sent to 2696 adults aged 18 years or over, in four areas of Greenwich, London. Mental health was measured using the SF36 subscales for mental health (MH) and vitality (V). Additional household and area level data were appended for each respondent from a range of sources.Results: 1012 questionnaires were returned (38% response rate). At the univariate level significant confounders that were associated with poorer mental well-being were being female, 85+ years, unemployed or retired, on housing benefit, council tenant, two or more children, and having requested re-housing Better mental wellbeing was associated with being aged 65 years to 84 years (better MH and V). Within domain analysis, adjusting for each of the confounding factors, resulted in the following factors being significantly associated with being in the lowest quartile for MH score: (i) control over the internal environment (damp), (ii) design and maintenance (not liking the took of the estate/road, (iii) noise (neighbour noise), (iv) density and escape (feeling over-crowded in the home, being dissatisfied with green spaces, dissatisfied with social and entertainment facilities) being dissatisfied with community facilities (such as libraries and community centres) was only significant for vitality, (v) fear of crime and harassment (feeling unsafe to go out in the day, feeling unsafe to go out at night, agreeing that needles and syringes left tying around are a problem) (vi) social participation (not enough events to get people together, not enough places to stop and chat). When these 12 factors were entered into a single model with the significant confounders five remained significantly associated with being in the lowest quartile for MH or V: neighbour noise MH OR 2.71 [95% CI 1.48, 4.98]; feeling over-crowded in the home MH OR 2.22 [1.42, 3.48]; being dissatisfied with access to green open spaces MH OR 1.69 [1.05, 2.74]; access to community facilities V OR 1.92, [1.24, 3.00]; feeling unsafe to go out in the day MH OR 1.64 [1.02, 2.64]; V OR 1.58 [1.00, 2.49].Conclusions: This study confirms an association between the physical environment and mental well-being across a range of domains. The most important factors that operate independently are neighbour noise, sense of over-crowding in the home and escape facilities such as green spaces and community facilities, and fear of crime. This study highlights the need to intervene on both design and social features of residential areas to promote mental well-being. (c) 2006 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

Greenspace and park use associated with less emotional distress among college students in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Larson, LR; Mullenbach, LE; Browning, MHEM; Rigolon, A; Thomsen, J; Metcalf, EC; Reigner, NP; Sharaievska, I; McAnirlin, O; D'Antonio, A; Cloutier, S; Helbich, M; Labib, SM","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected many people's psychological health. Impacts may be particularly severe among socially vulnerable populations such as college students, a group predisposed to mental health problems. Outdoor recreation and visits to greenspaces such as parks offer promising pathways for addressing the mental health challenges associated with COVID-19. During the early stages of the pandemic (March-May 2020), we surveyed 1280 college students at four large public universities across the United States (U.S.) to assess how, and why, outdoor recreation and park use changed since the emergence of COVID-19. We also measured students' self-reported levels of emotional distress (a proxy for psychological health) and assessed potential demographic and contextual correlates of distress, including county-level per capita park area and greenness, using generalized linear models. We found that 67% of students reported limiting outdoor activities and 54% reported reducing park use during the pandemic. Students who reduced their use of outdoor spaces cited structural reasons (e.g., lockdowns), concerns about viral transmission, and negative emotions that obstructed active lifestyles. Students who maintained pre-pandemic park use levels expressed a desire to be outdoors in nature, often with the explicit goal of improving mental and physical health. Emotional distress among students was widespread. Models showed higher levels of emotional distress were associated with reducing park use during the pandemic and residing in counties with a smaller area of parks per capita. This study of U.S. college students supports the value of park-based recreation as a health promotion strategy for diverse populations of young adults during a time of crisis.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,204,,,WOS:000730784600004,10.1016/j.envres.2021.112367,,#2169,Larson 2022,
"Understanding the Differential Impact of Vegetation Measures on Modeling the Association between Vegetation and Psychotic and Non-Psychotic Disorders in Toronto, Canada","Abdullah, AM; Law, J; Butt, ZA; Perlman, CM","Considerable debate exists on whether exposure to vegetation cover is associated with better mental health outcomes. Past studies could not accurately capture people's exposure to surrounding vegetation and heavily relied on non-spatial models, where the spatial autocorrelation and latent covariates could not be adjusted. Therefore, a suite of five different vegetation measures was used to separately analyze the association between vegetation cover and the number of psychotic and non-psychotic disorder cases in the neighborhoods of Toronto, Canada. Three satellite-based and two area-based vegetation measures were used to analyze these associations using Poisson lognormal models under a Bayesian framework. Healthy vegetation cover was found to be negatively associated with both psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. Results suggest that the satellite-based indices, which can measure both the density and health of vegetation cover and are also adjusted for urban and environmental perturbations, could be better alternatives to simple ratio- and area-based measures for understanding the effect of vegetation on mental health. A strong dominance of spatially structured latent covariates was found in the models, highlighting the importance of adopting a spatial approach. This study can provide critical guidelines for selecting appropriate vegetation measures and developing spatial models for future population-based epidemiological research.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,9,,WOS:000650280800001,10.3390/ijerph18094713,,#2172,Abdullah 2021,
Inland Waterways and Population Health and Wellbeing: A Cross-Sectional Study of Waterway Users in the UK,"Afentou, N; Moore, P; Hull, K; Shepherd, J; Elliott, S; Frew, E","Natural environments, such as inland waterways (IWs), have been identified as a potential means to increase physical activity and promote health and wellbeing. However, further information on predictors of IW usage and their relationship with health and wellbeing outcomes is needed. Data were taken from the cross-sectional UK Waterways Engagement Monitor survey of waterway users (n = 21,537) in 2019/2020. Health outcome measures were life satisfaction, physical activity, and mental wellbeing. Visit frequency was an additional outcome measure. Both bivariate and multivariable associations between outcome measures and features of IWs were explored. The travel-cost method was used to estimate users' demand, expressed by travel costs to waterways. Multivariable models showed positive associations of frequent visits and use for recreational/leisure purposes with life satisfaction and physical activity. Rural visits were associated with higher life satisfaction than urban ones. Lower visit satisfaction negatively impacted life satisfaction and mental wellbeing. Visit frequency was influenced by individual characteristics and purpose of visit, including visits for exercise. Waterway visits were inversely associated with travel costs (IRR = 0.99, p-value <= 0.001), and there was greater demand elasticity for short distances (<= 5 miles). Socioeconomic-related inequalities were present. Future policies could enhance frequent use of waterways and alleviate accessibility-related inequalities to improve population health outcomes.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,21,,WOS:000881094300001,10.3390/ijerph192113809,,#2184,Afentou 2022,
Effects of Plant Communities on Human Physiological Recovery and Emotional Reactions: A Comparative Onsite Survey and Photo Elicitation Study,"Duan, YF; Li, SH","We investigated the effects on humans, in terms of skin conductance levels (SCLs) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) scores, of plant communities that differed in their vegetation structure (single-layer woodland, tree-shrub-grass composite woodland, tree-grass composite woodland, and single-layer grassland) through two perceptual methods: onsite surveying and photo elicitation. The results showed that (1) the choice of perception method significantly impacted the PANAS scores of the participants but had no influence on the SCL and (2) viewing a single-layer grassland reduced the SCL (representing the physiological stress level) and improved the positive affect score. The recovery effects for the four vegetation communities were ranked in the order of single-layer grassland > tree-shrub-grass composite woodland > single-layer woodland > tree-grass composite woodland. (3) Gender and professional background significantly impacted the plant community perception methods and landscape experience, and negative affect scores were lower for male participants than for female participants. Participants without backgrounds in landscape design exhibited higher positive affect scores under photo elicitation. Based on the conclusions drawn above, the onsite survey is preferable between the two perception methods. It is recommended that in future landscape designs, combinations of plant community types should be reasonably matched through onsite perception. These research results can provide a scientific basis for the future design of landscapes based on perception experience.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,2,,WOS:000749540500001,10.3390/ijerph19020721,,#2186,Duan 2022,
The effect of urban nature exposure on mental health-a case study of Guangzhou,"Liu, HX; Ren, H; Remme, RP; Nong, HF; Sui, CH","There is considerable evidence concerning the salutary effects of nature on mental health in developed countries. However, these benefits are less examined and recognized in Chinese cities where 11%-15% of the population are facing increasing mental health issues. To provide more comprehensive evidence concerning nature's benefits on multiple components of mental health in Chinese cities, we address two poorly resolved questions: i) does exposure to urban park and blue space have equivalent associations with multiple components of mental health? ii) do these associations vary across gender and socioeconomic groups? We conducted two waves of cross-sectional surveys in Guangzhou and investigated 1,274 respondents' (933 from online survey and 341 from face-to-face survey) depression risk and four aspects of subjective well-being (SWB) including life satisfaction, worthwhileness, happy yesterday, and anxious yesterday. The results suggest that both park and blue space exposure mitigate depression risk and negative affect well-being, however their associations vary with evaluative, eudemonic, and positive affect well-being. Achieving SWB across all its components needs access to both park and blue space. One-hectare increase in accessible water is associated with an improvement up to 0.45% anxious yesterday scores indicating blue space a potential public health resource. We observed a clear gender and socioeconomic differences: nearby nature has stronger protective effects for female, lower educated and low-to-median income population groups than their counterpart. Although the heterogeneities need to be confirmed in other urban settings, our findings suggest that effective actions need to consider gender-and socioeconomic differences to target potential beneficiaries and maximize the returns of investments and policy interventions.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Happiness is greater in natural environments,"MacKerron, G; Mourato, S","Links between wellbeing and environmental factors are of growing interest in psychology, health, conservation, economics, and more widely. There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals' immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life.

"Are greenspace quantity and quality associated with mental health through different mechanisms in Guangzhou, China: A comparison study using street view data","Wang, RY; Feng, ZQ; Pearce, J; Liu, Y; Dong, GH","Residential greenspace quality may be more important for people's mental health than the quantity of greenspace. Existing literature mainly focuses on greenspace quantity and is limited to exposure metrics based on an over-head perspective (i.e., remote sensing data). Thus, whether greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health through different mechanisms remains unclear. To compare the mechanisms through which greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health, we used both remote sensing and street view data. Questionnaire data from 1003 participants in Guangzhou, China were analysed cross-sectionally. Mental health was assessed through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Greenspace quantity was measured by both remote sensing-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Street View Greenness-quantity (SVG-quantity). Greenspace quality was measured by both Street View Greenness-quality (SVG-quality) and questionnaire-based self-reported greenspace quality. Structural equation models were used to assess mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure has an influence on mental health. Stress, social cohesion, physical activity and life satisfaction were found to mediate both SVG-quality - WHO-5 scores and self-reported greenspace quality - WHO-5 scores associations. However, only NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) mediated the association between NDVI and WHO-5 scores, while NO2, perceived pollution and social cohesion mediated the association between SVG-quantity and WHO-5 scores. The mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure influences mental health may vary across different exposure assessment strategies.

(3) Results: The frequency of use and accessibility of multiple facilities in the health service facilities were significantly associated with self-rated health (SRH). Significant differences occurred between residents' perceived accessibility and actual accessibility of facilities in SRH. Comparing the results of SRPH and SRMH revealed that the influencing factors that affect the two vary. The factors that significantly affect SRMH include neighborhood physical environment evaluation; social environmental evaluation; the frequency of use of the parks and squares, and sports zones; and the accessibility of parks and squares, specialized hospitals, community hospitals, and pharmacies. However, the factors that significantly affect SRPH include the frequency of use of sports venues, general hospitals, and pharmacies and the accessibility of general hospitals. The social environment of the neighborhood is also a non-negligible part, and its interaction with the physical environment of the neighborhood affects the outcome of SRH.

Health Benefits of Urban Allotment Gardening: Improved Physical and Psychological Well-Being and Social Integration,"Soga, M; Cox, DTC; Yamaura, Y; Gaston, KJ; Kurisu, K; Hanaki, K","With an ever-increasing urban population, promoting public health and well-being in towns and cities is a major challenge. Previous research has suggested that participating in allotment gardening delivers a wide range of health benefits. However, evidence from quantitative analyses is still scarce. Here, we quantify the effects, if any, of participating in allotment gardening on physical, psychological and social health. A questionnaire survey of 332 people was performed in Tokyo, Japan. We compared five self-reported health outcomes between allotment gardeners and non-gardener controls: perceived general health, subjective health complaints, body mass index (BMI), mental health and social cohesion. Accounting for socio-demographic and lifestyle variables, regression models revealed that allotment gardeners, compared to non-gardeners, reported better perceived general health, subjective health complaints, mental health and social cohesion. BMI did not differ between gardeners and non-gardeners. Neither frequency nor duration of gardening significantly influenced reported health outcomes. Our results highlight that regular gardening on allotment sites is associated with improved physical, psychological and social health.

"Residential greenness and prevalence of major depressive disorders: a cross-sectional, observational, associational study of 94 879 adult UK Biobank participants","Sarkar, C; Webster, C; Gallacher, J","Background Increased urbanisation and the associated reduced contact of individuals with natural environments have led to a rise in mental disorders, including depression. Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank.Methods In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37-73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0.5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates.Findings Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77.1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4.0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0.960, 95% CI 0.93-0.99; p=0.0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.Interpretation The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

Relationship between PSD of Park Green Space and Attention Restoration in Dense Urban Areas,"Zhu, ZX; Hassan, A; Wang, WJ; Chen, QB","Research shows that stress, a common problem in densely populated cities, can be relieved by exposure to the natural environment. As great significance has been attached to the relationship between the urban environment and public health, this paper aims to study the relationship and interaction between the perceived sensory dimensions of urban park green space, attention restoration, and state empathy. Therefore, we conducted an on-site questionnaire (PSD Scale) survey in four typical parks in Chengdu and recorded age, sex, daily stress, frequency of visits to parks, and other basic information from the respondents. In the survey and visit, we found that the group structure in the recreation area comprises chiefly of a few transient unfamiliar travelers and most long-haul neighborhood sightseers. Among long-haul vacationers, the greater part of them are moderately aged and older individuals in the encompassing local locations, whose lives are, for the most part, quick and proficient. Hence, to mirror the populace attributes of high-thickness metropolitan parks and to feature the agent bunches that have lived in the parks from here onward, indefinitely quite a while, the chosen bunches are somewhere in the range of 35 and 65 years old (half male and half female), so make sure there are no ailments, no drinking, and no late evenings in the earlier days, so a specific actual fundamental belief is kept up with. The main part of the exercise focused on the perceived dimension, state empathy, and attention restoration. The software SPSS24.0 was applied to the test of the validity and reliability of the perceived sensory dimension (PSD) Scale, and then the important correlation between the perceived sensory dimensions in the parks and visitors' attention restoration was analyzed through multiple linear regression. Finally, the moderating effect of state empathy was tested by PROCESS. The findings show that (1) only seven dimensions in the PSD Scale are effective; (2) Serene and Refuge in the perceived sensory dimensions have a significant effect on the restorative components of attention. (3) Except for the dimensions of Rich in Species and Refuge, empathy enhanced the moderation effect in the interaction between the other five dimensions of the Perceived Restorative Scale (PRS), especially in the interaction between the Social and PRS dimensions. However, this topic needs to be further explored to provide a scientific basis and design strategy for research on the restoration potential of urban park green space in high-density urban areas.",2022,,BRAIN SCIENCES,12,6,,WOS:000815899400001,10.3390/brainsci12060721,,#2249,Zhu 2022,
Emergency department visits for mental disorders and the built environment: Residential greenspace and historical redlining,"Wang, HQ; Li, DY","The built environment has been increasingly shown to impact mental health. However, little is known about how and the extent to which exposure to greenspace in the residential environment is associated with emergency department visits for mental disorders. In addition, despite recent findings highlighting the links between his-torical discriminatory housing policies and health outcomes, no evidence is available regarding historical red-lining and mental health. We aimed to investigate the extent to which the availability of greenspace in residential surroundings and historical redlining was associated with risks of mental disorder-related emergency department visits. In this ecological study, we analyzed state-wide data on emergency room visits for mental health in all metropolitan areas in Texas between 2016 and 2019. Greenspace coverage was determined using the National Land Cover Database. Historical redlining was defined as the type C (definitely declining) or D (hazardous) designations according to the 1930 s Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps. We fitted a conditional autoregressive spatial model with zero truncated negative binomial distribution to assess associations among emergency department visits, greenspace availability, and redlining, adjusted for risk and protective urban and social-demographic factors. We found that, with a 1% increase in greenspace coverage in a zip code area, the risk of emergency department visits due to mental health disorders was expected to decrease by 0.16% (IRR = 0.9984, 95% CI: 0.9971-0.9997). Meanwhile, a 1% increase of historically redlining zones was associated with a 0.88% increase (IRR = 1.0088, 95% CI: 1.0056-1.0120) in the risk of emergency department visits for mental health disorders. Our findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments is linked to lower risks of emergency department visits for mental disorders. They also indicate that systematic segregation insti-tutionalized by historical housing policies might be related to present-day mental health-related emergency department visits. This study offers novel insights into the built environmental correlates of mental health and provides planning and policy implications related to mental health and health equity promotion.",2023,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,230,,,WOS:000884465100001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104568,,#2251,Wang 2023,
Relative importance of perceived physical and social neighborhood characteristics for depression: a machine learning approach,"Helbich, M; Hagenauer, J; Roberts, H","Purpose The physical and social neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as determinants for depression. There is little evidence on combined effects of multiple neighborhood characteristics and their importance. Our aim was (1) to examine associations between depression severity and multiple perceived neighborhood environments; and (2) to assess their relative importance. Methods Cross-sectional data were drawn from a population-representative sample (N = 9435) from the Netherlands. Depression severity was screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and neighborhood perceptions were surveyed. Supervised machine learning models were employed to assess depression severity-perceived neighborhood environment associations. Results We found indications that neighborhood social cohesion, pleasantness, and safety inversely correlate with PHQ-9 scores, while increasing perceived distance to green space and traffic were correlated positively. Perceived distance to blue space and urbanicity seemed uncorrelated. Young adults, low-income earners, low-educated, unemployed, and divorced persons were more likely to have higher PHQ-9 scores. Neighborhood characteristics appeared to be less important than personal attributes (e.g., age, marital and employment status). Results were robust across different ML models. Conclusions This study suggested that the perceived social environment plays, independent of socio-demographics, a role in depression severity. Contrasted with person-level and social neighborhood characteristics, the prominence of the physical neighborhood environment should not be overstated.",2020,,SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,55,5,599-610,WOS:000527274800008,10.1007/s00127-019-01808-5,,#2264,Helbich 2020,
The effect of place attachment and greenway attributes on well-being among older adults in Taiwan,"Han, B; Li, DY; Chang, PJ","This study examined the effects of the behavioral, environmental, and intermediate attributes of greenways on the well-being of older adults, especially regarding how place attachment can serve as an intermediate factor in achieving aging in place. Data were obtained from environmental evaluations and user surveys of 769 participants aged 55 and older throughout all 13 greenways of the Taichung Urban Greenway system. The regression models revealed that greenway quality, perceived pollution, activities on the greenways, neighborhood social capital, and place attachment had significant effects on well-being. Moreover, the greenness of the greenways had a more positive impact on the well-being of those older people who experienced greater levels of place attachment. The strengths of the current study include a focus on the synergistic effects that a greenway, place attachment, and neighborhood social capital have on well-being, thereby contributing to aging in place for the growing older population.",2021,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,65,,,WOS:000702902400003,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127306,,#2269,Han 2021,
Assessing the Correlation between Neighborhood Green Areas and the Perceived Mental Health of Residents in Metropolitan Areas,"Choi, KA; Rezaei, M","Background: Urban parks play a noticeable role in city areas for making connections between nature and the residents of cities, especially from a mental health perspective. This paper investigated how the number and types of urban parks impact city residents' mental health.Method: This study used the data collected by the Community Health Survey in Seoul, South Korea in 2020 (n=22915). The type and number of local parks were categorized based on each district, and three variables of mental health were selected, including 'subjective health awareness', 'stress awareness' and 'depression rate'. Correlation and interaction analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between variables.Result: The data indicated that both the quantity and types of the urban parks were associated with mental health of the residents. Positive mental health is likely to be associated with higher density of local parks in a district. It seems that parks characterized by children's activity and have nature-focused design, are more effective in changing the mental health of residents.Discussion: The research demonstrates a positive relationship between the quantity of urban parks and mental health in the scale of city districts. However, such a correlation can differ based on the type of parks, as well as the quantity of greenery in an area.",2022,,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,51,9,2027-2033,WOS:000859858400011,,,#2271,Choi 2022,
Workplace settings and wellbeing: Greenspace use and views contribute to employee wellbeing at peri-urban business sites,"Gilchrist, K; Brown, C; Montarzino, A","Low density business developments are a near ubiquitous feature of peri-urban landscapes in the UK and in other developed countries, however little is known about how workers relate to open space in this particular type of working environment. Person-environment relationships in five urban fringe science parks in central Scotland were investigated through a survey of employees (N=366). Specifically, the study sought to explore the impact of viewing and using greenspace at these knowledge-sector work-places on employee wellbeing. The results of a series of multiple regression analyses indicated that both use of the open space and views of some vegetation types, namely trees, lawn and shrubs or flowering plants, were positively and independently associated with self-reported wellbeing levels. This research provides new insight into the extent to which workplace greenspace contributes to employee wellbeing, whilst controlling for exposure to greenspace outside of the workplace context. Also, by investigating relationships between wellbeing and the particular physical features seen in views, the research provides evidence on how workplaces might be designed to incorporate restorative window views. These findings have relevance both for the planning and design of peri-urban business sites and for the design of interventions to promote employee wellbeing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Public Parks and Wellbeing in Urban Areas of the United States,"Larson, LR; Jennings, V; Cloutier, SA","Sustainable development efforts in urban areas often focus on understanding and managing factors that influence all aspects of health and wellbeing. Research has shown that public parks and green space provide a variety of physical, psychological, and social benefits to urban residents, but few studies have examined the influence of parks on comprehensive measures of subjective wellbeing at the city level. Using 2014 data from 44 U.S. cities, we evaluated the relationship between urban park quantity, quality, and accessibility and aggregate self-reported scores on the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index (WBI), which considers five different domains of wellbeing (e.g., physical, community, social, financial, and purpose). In addition to park-related variables, our best-fitting OLS regression models selected using an information theory approach controlled for a variety of other typical geographic and socio-demographic correlates of wellbeing. Park quantity (measured as the percentage of city area covered by public parks) was among the strongest predictors of overall wellbeing, and the strength of this relationship appeared to be driven by parks' contributions to physical and community wellbeing. Park quality (measured as per capita spending on parks) and accessibility (measured as the overall percentage of a city's population within 1/2 mile of parks) were also positively associated with wellbeing, though these relationships were not significant. Results suggest that expansive park networks are linked to multiple aspects of health and wellbeing in cities and positively impact urban quality of life.",2016,,PLOS ONE,11,4,,WOS:000373608000102,10.1371/journal.pone.0153211,,#2281,Larson 2016,
Assessing the association between urban features and human physiological stress response using wearable sensors in different urban contexts,"Zhang, ZX; Amegbor, PM; Sigsgaard, T; Sabel, CE","Public open space (POS) plays a significant role in fostering human health and wellbeing in cities. A major limitation of current research on POS and health is that there is little attention on the role of various urban features on people's mental health, in different urban context. This study employed wearable sensors (a wearable camera, Empatica 4 wristband and a GPS device) to measure human physiological responses to urban indicators, objectively. To do this, we selected six kinds of public open space (water area, transit area, green area, com-mercial area, motor traffic area and mixed office and residential area) and recruited 86 participants for an experimental study. Next, we detected urban features by using Microsoft Cognitive Services (MCS) and calculated a change score to assess human physiological stress responses based on galvanic skin response (GSR) and skin temperature from the wristband. Lastly, we applied random effect model and geographically weighted regression analysis to examine the relationship between urban indicators and human physiological stress responses. The findings show that urban flow (vehicles, bikes and people), waterbodies, greenery and places to sit are associated with the changes of human physiological stress response. The findings indicate that the type of urban context may confound the effect of green and blue urban features; i.e., the effect on physiological stress response can be positive or negative depending on the context.

Stress recovery in forest or handicraft environments - An intervention study,"Dolling, A; Nilsson, H; Lundell, Y","In modern society stress is a major problem, causing lack of mental and social well-being as well as potential vulnerability to problems at work. Previous studies have found natural environments to be relaxing. In this intervention study, performed in Northern Sweden, the hypothesis was that an outdoor forest environment would be more relaxing than an indoor handicraft environment. Forty-six participants with high stress levels (PSQ >= 0.4) (33 women, 13 men, average age 48 years) were randomly assigned to visit either the forest environment (n = 27) or the handicraft environment (n = 19). The participants visited their assigned environment twice a week during three months, either in autumn or spring. During each visit they spent two hours performing, simple and undemanding activities. Psychological health outcomes were measured by the questionnaires CIS, PSQ, SCQ, SMBQ, SF-36 before and after the three months interventions. Sleeping patterns were monitored by an Actiwatch and sleep diary. The participants' mood before and after each visit were estimated by a questionnaire. The results show that the participants' health had improved after the interventions in both the forest and handicraft environments. The sleep latency increased slightly among participants in the handicraft environment. For participants in both environments the levels of fatigue, stress and burnout were all lower. They felt less limitation due to physical problems and did not feel so tired. Also their mental health had improved. From start to end of a visit to either environments the participants' mood was improved, and they felt more relaxed, alert, happy, harmonious, peaceful and clearheaded. Over time during the intervention, they also felt significantly more clearheaded. We conclude that the health of all participants improved, irrespective of the environment visited.",2017,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,27,,162-172,WOS:000418470600020,10.1016/j.ufug.2017.07.006,,#2295,Dolling 2017,
"Not urbanization level but socioeconomic, physical and social neighbourhood characteristics are associated with presence and severity of depressive and anxiety disorders","Generaal, E; Timmermans, EJ; Dekkers, JEC; Smit, JH; Penninx, BWJH","Background. Which neighbourhood factors most consistently impact on depression and anxiety remains unclear. This study examines whether objectively obtained socioeconomic, physical and social aspects of the neighbourhood in which persons live are associated with the presence and severity of depressive and anxiety disorders.Methods. Cross-sectional data are from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety including participants (n = 2980) with and without depressive and anxiety disorders in the past year (based on DSM-based psychiatric interviews). We also determined symptom severity of depression (Inventory of Depression Symptomatology), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and fear (Fear Questionnaire). Neighbourhood characteristics comprised socioeconomic factors (socioeconomic status, home value, number of social security beneficiaries and percentage of immigrants), physical factors (air pollution, traffic noise and availability of green space and water) and social factors (social cohesion and safety). Multilevel regression analyses were performed with the municipality as the second level while adjusting for individual sociodemographic variables and household income.Results. Not urbanization grade, but rather neighbourhood socioecononomic factors (low socioeconomic status, more social security beneficiaries and more immigrants), physical factors (high levels of traffic noise) and social factors (lower social cohesion and less safety) were associated with the presence of depressive and anxiety disorders. Most of these neighbourhood characteristics were also associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms severity.Conclusion.

The experiment was conducted in a forest near an urban area and involved 61 participants (average age: 22.5 +/- 1.8). The participants selected one of three activities (pruning, stacking cut branches, and removing vines) in the forest conservation program. The effects of these activities on the musculoskeletal system were assessed using the Ovako Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS); the physical intensity of the activities was evaluated using heart rate data. The psychological evaluation measurement indexes used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument, and the Perceived Restorativeness Scale. As a result of the OWAS assessment, forest conservation activities were found to be action categories 1 and 2, which were less burdensome to the musculoskeletal system. All forestry activities were found to be light levels of physical intensity. Psychological evaluation of the participants revealed that positive emotions such as self-esteem, quality of life, and perceived restorativeness increased significantly, whereas negative emotions decreased significantly.

Urban Nature and Public Health: How Nature Exposure and Sociocultural Background Relate to Depression Risk,"Jakstis, K; Fischer, LK","As the world's population becomes more urbanized, there is an associated decrease in nature exposure and a rise in noncommunicable diseases, including depression. Previous cross-sectional studies examining urban nature exposure and depression have reported favorable associations. However, many of these studies rely primarily on nature exposure metrics that measure the intensity of nature exposure, while other dimensions of urban nature exposure remain understudied. Therefore, in a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based case study targeting a general urban population (n = 282), we examined the relationship between two less commonly studied urban nature exposure variables (i.e., gardening behavior and greenspace visit frequency) and depression risk while also considering sociocultural background (multivariate logistic regression model). Results indicated that being a gardener was significantly associated with a reduced odds of being at risk of depression and that having a family migration history, but not a self-migration history, was associated with increased odds of being at risk of depression. In the examination of neighborhood socialization frequency and depression risk, we did not determine any significant association. The results of this study, therefore, highlight the importance of considering both people's sociocultural backgrounds and urban nature exposure in more detail to help plan for and support healthier cities in the future.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,18,,WOS:000699728300001,10.3390/ijerph18189689,,#2322,Jakstis 2021,
Association of neighborhood parks with child health in the United States,"Reuben, A; Rutherford, GW; James, J; Razani, N","While there is evidence that parks support pediatric health, there have been no national studies looking at both physical and mental health. We assessed whether the presence of a neighborhood park is associated with pediatric physical or mental health across the U.S. using a nationally representative cross-sectional random sample of American children ages 0-17. Caregivers reported on the park presence in their child's neighborhood and the child's physical activity, screen-time, sleep, weight, and diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Covariates included child and family sociodemographics and, for 29 states, neighborhood urbanicity. Caregivers reported on 49,146 children (mean age 9.4 years; 49% female). There were 11,791 (24%) children living in neighborhoods lacking a park; children in non-urban locations (aOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40-1.67) or below the federal poverty level (aOR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.38-1.58) had higher odds of lacking a park.

One possible response to these challenges is the use of nature in cities. The aim of this study is to investigate how the objective quantity of natural space near the home, the perception of these natural elements, and their perceived availability, moderated by the effect of connectedness to nature, could explain levels of well-being. A survey was conducted among a sample of 1343 participants living in seven European cities. Data were collected online via a questionnaire. Indicators of the objective quantity of urban natural space based on remotely sensed satellite imagery were also used. Regression models highlight the association between well-being and perceived amount of nature, accessibility to a community garden, and level of connectedness to nature. A moderating and negative effect of connectedness to nature on the association between the perceived quantity of nature and well-being was also identified. Perception of nature seems to be a better indicator of well-being than the objective one. Results highlight the importance of the social dimension of collective gardens in enhancing well-being.

The observed landscape elements especially solitary plant specimens or tall and single-form trees within the garden can be embraced as design guidelines for the development of an evidence-based practice that can support the recovery process of people with mental health conditions.Conclusion:Our findings endorse that ongoing social development and progressive urbanization have broadened the interest in scientific research involving nature-based solutions that help preserve the physical and mental health of people in low- and middle-income Western Balkan countries with a high prevalence of mental disorders in the urban environment that relates to social inequalities and natural disasters.",2021,,HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL,14,4,242-257,WOS:000643435400001,10.1177/19375867211007941,,#2350,Trkulja 2021,
"Dynamic greenspace exposure and residents' mental health in Guangzhou, China: From over-head to eye-level perspective, from quantity to quality","Wang, RY; Feng, ZQ; Pearce, J; Zhou, SH; Zhang, L; Liu, Y","Natural environments especially greenspace may play an important role in enhancing people's mental health. However, the existing literature mainly assesses greenspace exposure in people's residential neighbourhood ignoring the dynamic nature of daily movements and residential histories. Also, most research assesses greenspace from an 'over-head' perspective whereas an 'eye-level' perspective may better capture people's experiences of greenspace, including its quality. We examine the importance of capturing people's eye-level greenspace exposure across different places people occupy in their everyday lives. We construct four measures of greenspace capturing overhead (NDVI), eye-level quantity and quality (Street View Greenness (SVG)) and self-reported neighbourhood greenness exposure. First, we assessed greenspace exposure in residential neighbourhoods, workplaces, recreational places, mobility path and previous residential neighbourhood. The four greenspace indicators were not associated with each other, suggesting they capture different aspects of greenspace. Second, we examine the associations between dynamic greenspace exposure and residents' mental health using survey data collected from 26 neighbourhoods of Guangzhou, China. The results show that all measures in residential places are associated with mental health. However, only SVG-quality in recreational places is positively associated with mental health, while both SVG-quantity and SVG-quality in participant's mobility path are associated with mental health. Our findings demonstrate eye-level greenspace quality is more important in relation to mental health. Policymakers and planners should focus not only on residential neighbourhoods, but also consider the wider environments that people encounter in their everyday lives.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,215,,,WOS:000696646500003,10.1016/j.lurbplan.2021.104230,,#2366,Wang 2021,
Community greenness and neurobehavioral health in children and adolescents,"Lee, M; Kim, S; Ha, M","Background: Neighborhood greenness appears to be beneficial to human health. However, there are few studies on the relationship between greenness of children's residential communities and their neurobehavioral health.Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between neighborhood greenness of children's residential area and their neurobehavioral health.Methods: We used a population-representative sample of school children (n = 1817) from 2012 and 2013 in South Korea. Parents or guardians of children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their children's neurobehavioral health. As a measurement for greenness, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) at a 30-m resolution was retrieved from the Landsat satellite data operated by NASA. The MSAVI values were categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, high greenness) and each child was assigned the mean MSAVI within a 1.6-km radius of residence. We applied survey regressions of the CBCL transformed scores on the 3 levels of greenness, controlling for age, sex, physical activity, monthly family income, exposure to second-hand smoke, exposure to NO2, and blood lead level.Results: High greenness was associated with a lower Total CBCL score compared to low greenness ( -2.33, 95% CI, -4.10 to -0.56). Externalizing Behavior showed a slightly stronger association with greenness than did Internalizing Behavior. The inverse relationship with greenness was strongest for Attention Problems (-1.32; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.06). The magnitudes of the association were strongest when the buffer distance was 1600 m.Conclusions: Greenness of residential neighborhood was associated with lower problematic behavior scores in children, especially aggressive behaviors and attention problems.

However, intervention studies are scarce. To help bridge this gap we conducted a repeat cross-sectional study exploring local resident and visitor well-being before and after a small-scale intervention aimed at improving the quality of an urban beach area in a deprived neighbourhood in Plymouth, United Kingdom. Physical alterations were cocreated with local stakeholders and residents, and accompanied by a series of on-site community events. Key outcomes were self-reported psychological well-being, satisfaction with personal safety and community belonging, and perceptions of site quality. Adjusted linear models showed that positive well-being (B = 7.42; 95% CI = 4.18-10.67) and life satisfaction (B = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-0.70) were both higher after the intervention compared to before, with associations for life satisfaction stronger among those who visited the site in the last four weeks. Associations with positive well-being were partially mediated by greater satisfaction with community belonging; and associations with life satisfaction were partially and independently mediated by greater satisfaction with personal safety and community belonging. Although caution needs to be taken due to the repeat cross-sectional design and the sampling of site visitors as well as local residents, the findings support the idea that environmental improvements to urban blue spaces can foster better psychological well-being, and underline the importance of community involvement in the process.",2021,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,215,,,WOS:000696801500003,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104232,,#2372,vandenBogerd 2021,
Planting urban trees to improve quality of life? The life satisfaction impacts of urban afforestation,"Jones, BA","As cities around the world undertake large-scale urban afforestation projects, knowledge gaps continue to exist regarding their impacts on quality of life. Using individual-level life satisfaction (LS) data from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over 2005-2010, this paper investigates the subjective well-being impacts of the MillionTreesNYC afforestation program in New York City. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that LS is higher by 0.018 points on a 4-point scale during the first 3-years of the program. Consistent with a causal story, impacts are growing in magnitude as more trees are planted and I show no impacts during the months when deciduous trees have no foliage. Between 2007 and 2010, MillionTreesNYC generated an externality equivalent to a $505 (6.5%) increase in average per capita monthly household income.

"Recreational values of the natural environment in relation to neighbourhood satisfaction, physical activity, obesity and wellbeing","Bjork, J; Albin, M; Grahn, P; Jacobsson, H; Ardo, J; Wadbro, J; Ostergren, PO; Skarback, E","Objectives: The aim of this population-based study was to investigate associations between recreational values of the close natural environment and neighbourhood satisfaction, physical activity, obesity and wellbeing.Methods: Data from a large public health survey distributed as a mailed questionnaire in suburban and rural areas of southern Sweden were used (N = 24 819; 59% participation rate). Geocoded residential addresses and the geographical information system technique were used to assess objectively five recreational values of the close natural environment: serene, wild, lush, spacious and culture.Results: On average, a citizen of the Scania region, inner city areas excluded, only had access to 0.67 recreational values within 300 metres distance from their residence. The number of recreational values near the residence was strongly associated with neighbourhood satisfaction and physical activity. The effect on satisfaction was especially marked among tenants and the presence of recreational values was associated with low or normal body mass index in this group. A less marked positive association with vitality among women was observed. No evident effect on self-rated health was detectable.Conclusions: Immediate access to natural environments with high recreational values was rare in the study population and was distributed in an inequitable manner. Moreover, such access was associated with a positive assessment of neighbourhood satisfaction and time spent on physical activity, which can be expected to reduce obesity and increase vitality by having a buffering effect on stress.",2008,,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,62,4,,WOS:000253989600020,10.1136/jech.2007.062414,,#2409,Bjork 2008,
"Study of the Vertical Structures, Thermal Comfort, Negative Air Ions, and Human Physiological Stress of Forest Walking Spaces in Summer","Lin, W; Zeng, CC; Nie, WB; Nan, XG; Shen, SS; Shi, Y; Yan, H; Yang, F; Wu, RW; Bao, ZY","Forest walking is a popular, healthy, and light outdoor activity. The potential comprehensive relationships between the vertical structures, thermal comfort, negative air ions (NAI), and human physiological stress in forest walking spaces have not been determined. We performed an experiment in the Baishuihe National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Thirty-two college students recruited as subjects completed a forest walk (approximately one kilometer) on the same trail divided into three vertical structure type subsections, namely: A (dense herb and shrub layers with a sparse tree layer), B (dense tree, herb and shrub layers), and C (dense tree and herb layers with a sparse shrub layer). When the subjects passed preset environmental measurement points, staff measured climatic indexes (air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, surface temperature and global radiation) and NAI levels, and these data were input into the Rayman model to form a comprehensive thermal comfort index, the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). PET and NAI differences and dynamic data among the subsections were analyzed. The subjects' brain waves, heart rates (HRs), and walking speed (S) were digitally recorded. We selected brain wave theta, gamma and beta-high/alpha rates, neuroemotional indexes (stress and relaxation) and HR as physiological indicators, and S as an auxiliary indicator. The correlations between PET and NAI with physiological and auxiliary indexes were analyzed. Forest type C showed the lowest PETs and highest NAIs along with the most stable dynamic changes. PET was negatively correlated with HR and positively correlated with gamma (12 channels). NAI was positively correlated with S and relaxation and negatively correlated with gamma (two channels) and the fi-high/ff ratio (five channels). These comprehensive relationships suggest that dense tree, sparse shrub, and high-coverage herb layers combined with optimal temporal conditions (before noon or after a light rain) form the best thermal comfort and NAI conditions conducive to reducing human physiological pressures during summer daytime forest walking. These results provide theoretical references for forest walking and spatial regulation.",2022,,FORESTS,13,2,,WOS:000843203800001,10.3390/f13020335,,#2418,Lin 2022,
"The neighborhood effect of exposure to blue space on elderly individuals' mental health: A case study in Guangzhou, China","Chen, YJ; Yuan, Y","Within the urban setting, blue space refers to all visible surface waters, including lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. Exposure to the natural environment, especially blue space, has been consistently linked to better mental health. While previous studies have disentangled the positive relationship between neighborhood blue space and mental health, scant attention has been paid to pathways through which neighborhood blue space affects mental health among Chinese urban elderly individuals. Based on questionnaire data collected from Guangzhou in 2018, remote sensing images, street-scapes, and other such sources, we extracted various blue space indicators. We employed multilevel linear regression modeling, mediating effect modeling to examine bio-psychosocial pathways and mechanisms linking exposure to blue space and elderly individuals' mental health. Propensity score matching method was employed to deal with selection bias. According to this empirical analysis, firstly, neighborhood exposure to blue space was significantly associated with elderly individuals' mental health. Secondly, environmental harm reduction, stress reduction, and social contact facilitation played a separate role in mediating the effect of blue space exposure on elderly individuals' mental health. These findings confirm the mediation pathways in the context of Chinese cities. Our research enriches the empirical research on blue space and public health from the perspective of health geography, and suggests the need for ""healthy neighborhood"" and ""health aging"" planning in Chinese settings.",2020,,HEALTH & PLACE,63,,,WOS:000541164200025,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102348,,#2422,Chen 2020,

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of a 3-day stay in a bamboo forest on the psychological responses of participants. In our study, 120 volunteers between the ages of 19 and 24, including 60 males and 60 females, participated in the test. Four sites were selected for the test, including two natural bamboo forests (YA and YB), a bamboo park (DJY), and an urban environment (CS). During the testing period, all participants were asked to view the landscape for 15 min in the morning and then walk in the testing area for 15 min in the afternoon. A profile of mood state questionnaire was used to evaluate mood. In the bamboo forest environment, the scores of the participants for tension and anxiety, anger and hostility, depression, fatigue, and confusion after forest therapy were significantly lower than those of the participants in the urban area, while the scores of these participants for vigor were significantly higher than those of the participants in the urban area.

Coping with poverty - Impacts of environment and attention in the inner city,"Kuo, FE","Considerable evidence suggests that exposure to ""green"" environments can enhance human effectiveness and make life's demands seem manageable. Does this phenomenon extend to poor inner cities, where green space is minimal and life's demands may be overwhelming? In 145 urban public housing residents randomly assigned to buildings with and without nearby nature, attentional functioning and effectiveness in managing major life issues were compared. Residents living in buildings without nearby trees and grass reported more procrastination in facing their major issues and assessed their issues as more severe, less soluble, and more long-standing than did their counterparts living in greener surroundings. Mediation tests and extensive tests for possible confounds supported the attention restoration hypothesis-that green space enhances residents' effectiveness by reducing mental fatigue.

Environmental Determinants of Aggression in Adolescents: Role of Urban Neighborhood Greenspace,"Younan, D; Tuvblad, C; Li, LF; Wu, J; Lurmann, F; Franklin, M; Berhane, K; McConnell, R; Wu, AH; Baker, LA; Chen, JC","Objective: Neighborhood greenspace improves mental health of urban-dwelling populations, but its putative neurobehavioral benefits in adolescents remain unclear. We conducted a prospective study on urban-dwelling adolescents to examine the association between green space in residential neighborhood and aggressive behaviors.Method: Participants (n = 1,287) of the Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior Study, a multi-ethnic cohort of twins and triplets born in 1990 to 1995 and living in Southern California, were examined in 2000 to 2012 (aged 9-18 years) with repeated assessments of their aggressive behaviors by the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery was used as a proxy for residential neighborhood greenspace aggregated over various spatiotemporal scales before each assessment. Multilevel mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effects of greenspace on aggressive behaviors, adjusting for within-family/within-individual correlations and other potential confounders.Results: Both short-term (1- to 6-month) and long-term (1- to 3-year) exposures to greenspace within 1,000 meters surrounding residences were associated with reduced aggressive behaviors. The benefit of increasing vegetation over the range (similar to 0.12 in NDVI) commonly seen in urban environments was equivalent to approximately 2 to 2.5 years of behavioral maturation. Sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) and neighborhood quality did not confound or modify these associations, and the benefits remained after accounting for temperature.Conclusion: Our novel findings support the benefits of neighborhood greenspace in reducing aggressive behaviors of urban-dwelling adolescents.

Register-based data enabled us to avoid these problems in this longitudinal study on the associations between socioeconomic and physical neighbourhood characteristics and individual antidepressant use in three national contexts. Methods We used register-based longitudinal data on the population aged 50+ from Turin (Italy), Stockholm (Sweden), and the nine largest cities in Finland linked to satellite-based land-cover data. This included individual-level information on sociodemographic factors and antidepressant use, and on neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics, levels of urbanicity, green space and land-use mix (LUM). We assessed individual-level antidepressant use over 6 years in 2001-2017 using mixed-effects logistic regression. Results A higher neighbourhood proportion of low-educated individuals predicted lower odds for antidepressant use in Turin and Stockholm when individual-level sociodemographic factors were controlled for. Urbanicity predicted increased antidepressant use in Stockholm (OR=1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03) together with more LUM (OR=1.03; 1.01-1.05) and population density (OR=1.08; 1.05-1.10). The two latter characteristics also predicted increased antidepressant use in the Finnish cities (OR=1.05; 1.02-1.08 and OR=1.14; 1.02-1.28, respectively). After accounting for all studied neighbourhood and individual characteristics of the residents, the neighbourhoods still varied by odds of antidepressant use. Conclusions Overall, the associations of neighbourhood socioeconomic and physical characteristics with older people's antidepressant use were small and inconsistent. However, we found modest evidence that dense physical urban environments predicted higher antidepressant use among older people in Stockholm and the Finnish cities.",2021,,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,75,5,426-432,WOS:000639443600003,10.1136/jech-2020-214276,,#2442,Tarkiainen 2021,
Role of Space Qualities of Urban Parks on Mood Change,"Pazhouhanfar, M","Current literature shows an adequate evidence of the importance of urban parks on people health, especially to reduce stress.

Study showed that three variables of space qualities including ""fresh air"", ""tree and greening"" and ""flower"" positively predicted mood state. The finding of this study also showed that attitudes towards ""tree and greening"" and ""flower"" were different. ""Flower"" was found as the most influential space quality to explain the mood state for women, while ""tree and greening"" was profound among men.

Tree canopy cover was calculated as percent cover within 100 and 500 m radii buffers around participants' homes. We performed multilevel mixed effects linear regression models, with perceived stress as the dependent variable. The main independent variable was tree canopy coverage. Individual level covariates included season of last menstrual period, history of depression or anxiety, race/ethnicity, insurance, parity, and age. Census tract neighborhood deprivation index was used to account for area-level socioeconomic confounding variables. We also examined whether a history of anxiety or depression, modified the association between tree canopy coverage and perceived stress.Results: Most participants were non-Hispanic Black (70.6%, n = 913), on Medicaid or uninsured (60.4%, n = 781), and 15.8% (n = 204) of participants had a prior history of depression or anxiety. We did not detect associations between tree canopy coverage and perceived stress overall. However, we detected effect modification; among participants with a history of depression or anxiety, each standard deviation increase in tree canopy cover was associated with lower PSS-14 in 100 m buffers (beta-1.0, 95% CI-1.8,-0.2), but not among participants with no histories of depression or anxiety (beta 0.2, 95% CI-0.3, 0.7) (interaction P = 0.007).

A significant proportion of these are delivered close to home, because this offers an immediate and easily accessible opportunity for people to experience nature. However, there is limited information to guide recommendations on its management and appropriate use. We apply a nature dose-response framework to quantify the simultaneous association between exposure to nearby nature and multiple health benefits. We surveyed ca. 1000 respondents in Southern England, UK, to determine relationships between (a) nature dose type, that is the frequency and duration (time spent in private green space) and intensity (quantity of neighbourhood vegetation cover) of nature exposure and (b) health outcomes, including mental, physical and social health, physical behaviour and nature orientation. We then modelled dose-response relationships between dose type and self-reported depression. We demonstrate positive relationships between nature dose and mental and social health, increased physical activity and nature orientation. Dose-response analysis showed that lower levels of depression were associated with minimum thresholds of weekly nature dose.

How nature nurtures: Amygdala activity decreases as the result of a one-hour walk in nature,"Sudimac, S; Sale, V; Kuhn, S","Since living in cities is associated with an increased risk for mental disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia, it is essential to understand how exposure to urban and natural environments affects mental health and the brain. It has been shown that the amygdala is more activated during a stress task in urban compared to rural dwellers. However, no study so far has examined the causal effects of natural and urban environments on stress-related brain mechanisms. To address this question, we conducted an intervention study to investigate changes in stress-related brain regions as an effect of a one-hour walk in an urban (busy street) vs. natural environment (forest). Brain activation was measured in 63 healthy participants, before and after the walk, using a fearful faces task and a social stress task. Our findings reveal that amygdala activation decreases after the walk in nature, whereas it remains stable after the walk in an urban environment. These results suggest that going for a walk in nature can have salutogenic effects on stress-related brain regions, and consequently, it may act as a preventive measure against mental strain and potentially disease. Given rapidly increasing urbanization, the present results may influence urban planning to create more accessible green areas and to adapt urban environments in a way that will be beneficial for citizens' mental health.",,,MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY,,,,WOS:000849679800001,10.1038/s41380-022-01720-6,,#2482,,

A growing body of evidence suggests that a unique subcategory of ""contemplative landscapes"" is particularly therapeutic. Previous studies predominantly focused on observational designs in non-clinical populations. It is not known if these effects can be extrapolated to populations suffering from depression, and experimental designs need to be utilized to establish causality. We examined the effects of in-situ passive exposure to three urban spaces on brain activity, namely a Therapeutic Garden with high Contemplative Landscape scores (TG), Residential Green (RG) and Busy Downtown (BD), and self-reported momentary mood in adults aged 21-74 (n = 92), including 24 clinically depressed and 68 healthy participants. Portable, multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems were used to record brain activity, and a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire was used to record mood before and after exposure. We tested the interactions between the site, time and group for the mood, and between site and group for the neuroelectric oscillations and brain hemodynamics. Self-reported pre- post-mood was significant only at the TG (p = 0.032) in both groups. The lowest Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) was reported at TG and the highest in BD (p = 0.026). Results from fNIRS indicated marginally significant lower oxy-Hb in the frontal region at TG as compared to BD (p = 0.054) across both groups. The marginally significant effect of site and group was also observed (p = 0.062), with the Clinical group showing much lower oxy-Hb at TG than Healthy. The opposite pattern was observed at BD. EEG results showed differences between Healthy and Clinical groups in the Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) pattern across the sites (p = 0.04), with more frontal alpha right in the Clinical sample and more left lateralization in the Healthy sample at TG. Temporal Beta Asymmetry (TBA) analyses suggested that patients displayed lower bottom-up attention than Healthy participants across all sites (p = 0.039). The results suggest that both healthy and depressed adults benefitted from exposure to TG, with possibly different pathways of mood improvement. Visiting therapeutic nature with contemplative features may provide valuable support for the treatment of depression in clinical populations and a self-care intervention in non-clinical populations.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,13,,,WOS:000791402700001,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.757056,,#2489,Olszewska-Guizzo 2022,
Determinants of restorative experiences in everyday favorite places,"Korpela, KM; Ylen, M; Tyrvainen, L; Silvennoinen, H","The study was based on the answers to a mailed questionnaire of a simple random sample of respondents from two cities (Helsinki, Tampere) in Finland. Ten determinants of restorative experiences in favorite places (<= 15 km from home; n = 1089) were effective. These determinants included ""immediate"" use of the favorite place (duration and frequency), personal background of nature experiences (nature orientedness, nature hobbies, childhood nature experiences), and situational factors in life, which were related to stress (hassles at work and with money, satisfaction with life) and to social relations (uplifts of social relations, visiting alone vs. in company). Different variables were associated with restorative experiences in different favorite settings (extensively managed nature areas, built-up green spaces, waterside environments, exercise and activity/hobby areas, and indoor and outdoor urban areas). The concept of ""favorite place prescriptions"" is introduced as an analogy to ""exercise prescriptions"" in primary healthcare. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

At baseline and in each follow-up, we assigned NDVI based on participants' residential geocoded addresses and categorised it by quartiles.Outcome measures School-related, university-related or job-related self-reported chronic stress was assessed at the two follow-ups by the Trier Scale for Assessment of Chronic Stress using work discontent and work overload as outcomes. We modelled the association employing ordinal generalised estimating equations model accounting for changes in sociodemographics, non-job-related stress, job history and environmental covariates. Stratified analysis by each city was performed.Results NVDI at baseline was higher for participants from Dresden (median=0.36; IOR 0.31-0.41) than Munich (0.31; 0.26-0.34).

Introducing nature at the work floor: A nature-based intervention to reduce stress and improve cognitive performance,"Daniels, S; Clemente, DBP; Desart, S; Saenen, N; Sleurs, H; Nawrot, TS; Malina, R; Plusquin, M","Background: Although a growing body of research has shown that exposure to nature has restorative effects on human health, the potential beneficial effects of nature-based interventions in the working environment are still underexplored.& nbsp;Methods: We performed a randomized controlled study with a nature-based program during working hours. We enrolled employees, randomized the participants into two groups being an intervention and a control group. Twice a week for three consecutive weeks, the intervention group participated in nature-based activities for 2 h. The primary outcomes were cognitive performance, burnout assessment, salivary cortisol levels, and continuous stress levels. We performed intervention-response analyses using mixed-effects models that included random effects for each participant across the different examinations.& nbsp;Results: Compared to the control group (n = 20), the intervention group (n = 25) participating in the nature based program had a lower Burnout Assessment Tool score (-14.9% CI-16.2 to-14.3, difference; p < 0.001), lower salivary cortisol levels (-29.3% CI-34.7 to-25.3; p < 0.001) and higher visual information processing speed (7.4% CI6.9-8.0; p < 0.001). Selective attention of the participants that participated in the nature-based program improved during the interventions (-10.6 CI-19.6 to-6.9, p = 0.045), compared to the controls.& nbsp;Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence that exposure to nature during work hours reduces stress and improves cognitive performance.

"Mental Health, Greenness, and Nature Related Behaviors in the Adult Population of Stockholm County during COVID-19-Related Restrictions","Lohmus, M; Stenfors, CUD; Lind, T; Lauber, A; Georgelis, A","International data suggest that exposure to nature is beneficial for mental health and well-being. The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have created a setting that allows us to investigate the importance of greenness exposure on mental health during a period of increased isolation and worry. Based on 2060 responses from an online survey in Stockholm County, Sweden, we investigated: (1) whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed peoples' lifestyle and nature-related habits, and (2) if peoples' mental health differed depending on their exposure to greenness. Neighborhood greenness levels were quantified by using the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within 50 m, 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m buffers surrounding the participant's place of residence. We found that the number of individuals that reported that they visited natural areas ""often"" was significantly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Higher levels of greenness surrounding one's location of residence were in general associated with higher mental health/well-being and vitality scores, and less symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived and cognitive stress, after adjustments for demographic variables and walkability. In conclusion, the results from the present study provided support to the suggestion that contact with nature may be important for mental health in extreme circumstances.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,6,,WOS:000639212700001,10.3390/ijerph18063303,,#2519,Lohmus 2021,
"Metric or topological proximity? The associations among proximity to parks, the frequency of residents' visits to parks, and perceived stress","Chiang, YC; Li, DY","Urban parks provide multiple environmental, social, and salutary benefits for city-dwellers. People who have easy access to parks tend to engage in physical activity more frequently than others. The accessibility of parks is usually quantified using metric proximity, e.g., the distance from home. However, such metrics often fail to reflect the actual spatial configuration of the streets and people's actual experience in accessing the parks. The aim of this study was to quantify the access to parks based on the spatial configuration of streets and to determine whether such topological metrics was associated with people's use of parks. Using measures of space syntax, we examined the relationships among topological proximity, frequency of visits to parks, and perceived stress. We collected data from 964 people who visited 43 parks in Taipei City, Taiwan, to determine the frequency with which they visited parks and their stress levels. We used GIS to calculate indices of topological proximity. The results indicated that topological proximity was a significant predictor of the usage of parks. However, metric proximity measures, including Euclidean distance or actual walking distance, were not significant predictors. Increases in street connectivity and control value predicted higher frequencies of visits to parks. Regarding self-reported stress, topological proximity indices, connectivity, and control value were also significantly associated with stress. The use of a park partially mediated the relationship between topological proximity and stress levels. The findings regarding the effects of proximity on visits to parks provided implications for street layout planning and policy-making, and streetscape design.",2019,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,38,,205-214,WOS:000460053300021,10.1016/j.ufug.2018.12.011,,#2533,Chiang 2019,
"Greenspace, physical activity and well-being in Australian capital cities: how does population size moderate the relationship?","Ambrey, CL","Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the synergy between greenspace and physical activity and its implications for well-being. In particular, how this synergy may depend on population size in the neighborhood.Study design: Cross-sectional analysis of resident-level responses from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey for 2013 subset to Australia's major capital cities and linked to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data.Methods: GIS data on greenspace and Australian Bureau of Statistics data on population size for the neighborhood are matched to the residents in the HILDA survey on the basis of the Census Collection District in which they reside. A cluster-specific fixed effects model is estimated for the outcomes of mental health and psychological distress. A battery of sociodemographic and location characteristics were also adjusted for. Interaction terms are used to discern the extent to which population size may moderate any synergistic well-being benefits associated with physical activity and greenspace. This question is ultimately operationalized as a three-way interaction effect (greenspace x physical activity x population size).Results: The results indicate that physical activity is most strongly and positively associated with mental health (statistically significant at the 1% level), with an estimated coefficient of 0.6307. The results also reveal that physical activity is negatively associated with psychological distress (statistically significant at the 10% level), with an estimated coefficient of -0.2447. Unexpectedly, for both mental health and psychological distress the greenspace and population variables are not found to have separate statistically significant effects.Furthermore, while the results fail to find, on average, the hypothesized synergy between greenspace and physical activity, a closer inspection reveals that this link may depend on the population size of a neighborhood. The interaction term for greenspace, physical activity and population bears a coefficient estimate of 0.0033, statistically significant at the 5% level in the mental health regression and a coefficient of -0.0032, statistically significant at the 1% level in the psychological distress regression.Conclusion: The results indicate that physical activity is linked differently to mental health and psychological distress. The results initially provide no evidence of the hypothesized greenspacee-physical activity synergy. The results provide evidence that this synergy is greater in more populated neighborhoods.

From the perspective of ""dose of nature "", continuous contact with natural environments and engagement in natural activities can gradually promote positive health benefits. This study aims to explore the ""cumulative frequency of nature dose "" through regular forest walking. Ten college students were recruited to walk once a week for 30 min in the campus forest. Eight weeks of forest walking experiences were collected by administering questionnaires on nature relatedness, mental health, restorativeness, and learning engagement before the first walk, as well as after the fourth and the eighth walks. The findings of this study revealed that regular forest activities can induce accumulated natural benefits. By taking at least 30 min of forest walks once a week continuously for eight weeks, the subjects improved their mental health, increased learning engagement in school, gained more attention recovery and reflection experiences, and re-established a relationship with nature.

Nevertheless, the human psychological responses to urban roadside trees with different vegetation have not been fully explored. This study investigates the psychological states (mood, anxiety, restorative outcomes and subjective vitality) after short walks along different urban roads. Three-hundred and sixty-four participants visited four types of urban road: a road where buildings are concentrated was selected as a control road, and three roads surrounded by Sakura, London plane, and Metasequoia trees respectively. The Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Restorative Outcomes, and Subjective Vitality Scales were used to determine the participants' psychological responses. The physiologically equivalent temperature was utilized to assess the thermal comfort conditions of the selected roads. The results reveal that a short walk along urban roads surrounded by Metasequoia or Sakura or London plane trees respectively significantly reduced the negative psychological states of tension, fatigue, confusion, and anxiety compared to the control road. Additionally, the participants' restorative outcome and vitality were higher after walking along the Metasequoia and Sakura roads. Moreover, no significant differences in the psychological responses to the different roads were detected between male and female participants. Thermal adaptation and psychological parameters strongly affect human thermal comfort levels in outdoor spaces.

Results from the GreenCOVID study,"Garrido-Cumbrera, M; Foley, R; Correa-Fernandez, J; Gonzalez-Marin, A; Brace, O; Hewlett, D","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the daily lives of people and may affect their well-being. The aim of the present study is to assess well-being and associated factors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population in three European countries. Methods: GreenCOVID was an observational cross-sectional study using an online survey (7 April 2020 to 24 July 2020) promoted by the Health & Territory Research (HTR) of the University of Seville in Spain, Maynooth University in Ireland, and the University of Winchester in England, which included a sample of 3109 unselected adults. Well-being was measured using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) scale. Seven aspects, related to the natural environment of the home, were evaluated (role of outdoor views in coping with lockdown, importance of blue spaces during lockdown, importance of green spaces during lockdown, quality of view from home, use of outdoor spaces or window views, elements of nature in the home, and views of green or blue spaces from home). Binary logistic regression was conducted to identify the parameters associated with poor well-being. Results: Mean age was 39.7 years and 79.3% lived in Spain, the majority in urban areas (92.8%). 73.0% were female and 72.0% had undertaken university studies. Poor well-being was reported by 59.0%, while 26.6% indicated the possible presence of clinical depression. The factors most associated with poor well-being were students (OR = 1.541), those who had no engagement in physical activity (OR = 1.389), those who reported & lsquo;living in Spain & rsquo; compared to Ireland (OR = 0.724), being female (OR = 1.256), poor quality views from home (OR = 0.887), less benefit from views of the natural environment to cope with lockdown (OR = 0.964), and those younger in age (OR = 0.990). Conclusions: More than half of participants reported poor well-being and one in four indicated the possible presence of clinical depression during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified that belonging to a younger age cohort, being a student, being female, not being able to continue with daily pursuits such as physical activity, and having poorer quality of views from home led to poor well-being among participants.

The relationship between surrounding greenness in childhood and adolescence and depressive symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood,"Bezold, CP; Banay, RF; Coull, BA; Hart, JE; James, P; Kubzansky, LD; Missmer, SA; Laden, F","Purpose: Exposure to nature, particularly vegetation (greenness), may be beneficial for mental health. We investigated whether higher surrounding greenness in early life was associated with subsequent reduced risk of depressive symptoms and whether this association was modified by age, sex, or population density.Methods: Participants from the Growing Up Today Study were included if they reported on depressive symptoms between 1999 and 2013. Greenness exposure was characterized as the cumulative average normalized difference vegetation index value (1000 m resolution) from 1989 until 2 years before outcome assessment or age 18 based on geocoded addresses. We defined high depressive symptoms as the top 10% of scores on the McKnight Risk Factor Survey or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, depending on the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for socioeconomic status and other confounders.Results: There was a 6% lower incidence of high depressive symptoms associated with an interquartile range increase in greenness (95% confidence interval, 11%-0%). This relationship was stronger in higher population density areas (>1000 people/mi(2), 8% lower incidence, 95% confidence interval 15%-1%).Conclusions: Living in an area with greater surrounding greenness during childhood may be beneficial for mental health, particularly in more urban areas.

High-resolution land cover of greenspace and green-blue-space was assessed at 50, 100, 300 and 500 m buffers around residential addresses. Higher residential greenspace and green-blue-space were associated with lower levels of depressive and burnout symptoms among non-working individuals and with higher life satisfaction in the whole study population, after controlling for age, sex, individual income, and neighborhood socioeconomics. The immediate residential-surrounding environment (50 m) consistently showed the strongest associations with the outcomes. Having a partner was associated with better mental health outcomes and with having more residential greenspace, and adjusting for this rendered greenspace-health associations mostly statistically non-significant. In conclusion, higher levels of greenspace and green-blue-space in the immediate residential-surrounding environment were associated with better mental health outcomes in the present study, which contributes additional nuances to prior studies.

Effect of forest bathing on physiological and psychological responses in young Japanese male subjects,"Lee, J; Park, BJ; Tsunetsugu, Y; Ohira, T; Kagawa, T; Miyazaki, Y","Objective: To provide scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of forest bathing as a natural therapy by investigating its physiological benefits using biological indicators in outdoor settings.Study design: Within-group comparisons were used to examine psychological and physiological responses to exposure to real forest and urban environments.Methods: Young Japanese male adults participated in a 3-day, 2-night field experiment. Physiological responses as well as self-reported psychological responses to forest and urban environmental stimuli were measured in real settings. The results of each indicator were compared against each environmental stimulus.Results: Heart rate variability analysis indicated that the forest environment significantly increased parasympathetic nervous activity and significantly suppressed sympathetic activity of participants compared with the urban environment. Salivary cortisol level and pulse rate decreased markedly in the forest setting compared with the urban setting. In psychological tests, forest bathing significantly increased scores of positive feelings and significantly decreased scores of negative feelings after stimuli compared with the urban stimuli.Conclusion: Physiological data from this field experiment provide important scientific evidence on the health benefits of forest bathing. The results support the concept that forest bathing has positive effects on physical and mental health, indicating that it can be effective for health promotion. Despite the small sample size in this study, a very clear tendency towards positive physiological and psychological outcomes in forests was observed. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health.

CSP-14 in part showed significant differences-total score (p = 0.054, Cohen's d = 0.319), item ""integration"" (p = 0.028, Cohen's d = 0.365)-favoring the effects of the forest. These effects were more pronounced in summer (August). In October, during rainfall, we detected no relevant differences. POMS only showed a significant difference in the subcategory ""depression/anxiety"" in favor of the field. The amount of cortisol in saliva was not different between the groups. A short-term stay in a forest in summer caused a greater improvement in mood and well-being in HSP than in a field.

"Residential greenness, air pollution and psychological well-being among urban residents in Guangzhou, China","Wang, RY; Yang, BY; Yao, Y; Bloom, MS; Feng, ZQ; Yuan, Y; Zhang, JB; Liu, PH; Wu, WJ; Lu, Y; Baranyi, G; Wu, R; Liu, Y; Dong, GH","China's rapid urbanization has led to an increasing level of exposure to air pollution and a decreasing level of exposure to vegetation among urban populations. Both trends may pose threats to psychological well-being. Previous studies on the interrelationships among greenness, air pollution and psychological well-being rely on exposure measures from remote sensing data, which may fail to accurately capture how people perceive vegetation on the ground. To address this research gap, this study aimed to explore relationships among neighbourhood greenness, air pollution exposure and psychological well-being, using survey data on 1029 adults residing in 35 neighbourhoods in Guangzhou, China. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and streetscape greenery (SVG) to assess greenery exposure at the neighbourhood level, and we distinguished between trees (SVG-tree) and grasses (SVG-grass) when generating streetscape greenery exposure metrics. We used two objective (PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations) measures and one subjective (perceived air pollution) measure to quantify air pollution exposure. We quantified psychological well-being using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Results from multilevel structural equation models (SEM) showed that, for parallel mediation models, while the association between SVG-grass and psychological well-being was completely mediated by perceived air pollution and NO2, the relationship between SVG-tree and psychological well-being was completely mediated by ambient PM2.5, NO2 and perceived air pollution. None of three air pollution indicators mediated the association between psychological well-being and NDVI. For serial mediation models, measures of air pollution did not mediate the relationship between NDVI and psychological wellbeing. While the linkage between SVG-grass and psychological well-being scores was partially mediated by NO2-perceived air pollution, SVG-tree was partially mediated by both ambient PM2.5-perceived air pollution and NO2-perceived air pollution. Our results suggest that street trees may be more related to lower air pollution levels and better mental health than grasses are. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Residential Exposure to Urban Trees and Medication Sales for Mood Disorders and Cardiovascular Disease in Brussels, Belgium: An Ecological Study","Chi, DK; Aerts, R; Van Nieuwenhuyse, A; Bauwelinck, M; Demoury, C; Plusquin, M; Nawrot, TS; Casas, L; Somers, B","BACKGROUND: The available evidence for positive associations between urban trees and human health is mixed, partly because the assessment of exposure to trees is often imprecise because of, for instance, exclusion of trees in private areas and the lack of three-dimensional (3D) exposure indicators (e.g., crown volume).OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify all trees and relevant 3D structural traits in Brussels (Belgium) and to investigate associations between the number of trees, tree traits, and sales of medication commonly prescribed for mood disorders and cardiovascular disease.METHODS: We developed a workflow to automatically isolate all individual trees from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collected in 2012. Trait data were subsequently extracted for 309,757 trees in 604 census tracts. We used the average annual age-standardized rate of medication sales in Brussels for the period 2006 to 2014, calculated from reimbursement information on medication prescribed to adults (19-64 years of age). The medication sales data were provided by sex at the census tract level. Generalized log-linear models were used to investigate associations between the number of trees, the crown volume, tree structural variation, and medication sales. Models were run separately for mood disorder and cardiovascular medication and for men and women. All models were adjusted for indicators of area-level socioeconomic status.RESULTS: Single-factor models showed that higher stem densities and higher crown volumes are both associated with lower medication sales, but opposing associations emerged in multifactor models. Higher crown volume [an increase by one interquartile range (IQR) of 1.4 x 10(4) m(3)/ha] was associated with 34% lower mood disorder medication sales [women, beta = - 0.341 (95% CI: -0.379, -0.303); men, beta = - 0.340 (95% CI: -0.378, - 0.303)] and with 21-25% lower cardiovascular medication sales [women, beta = - 0.214 (95% CI: -0.246, -0.182); men, beta = - 0.252 (95% CI: - 0.285, -0.219)]. Conversely, a higher stem density (an increase by one IQR of 21.8 trees/ha) was associated with 28-32% higher mood disorder medication sales [women, beta = 0.322 (95% CI: 0.284, 0.361); men, beta = 0.281 (95% CI: 0.243, 0.319)] and with 20-24% higher cardiovascular medication sales [women, beta = 0.202 (95% CI: 0.169, 0.236); men, beta = 0.240 (95% CI: 0.206, 0.273)].DISCUSSION: We found a trade-off between the number of trees and the crown volumes of those trees for human health benefits in an urban environment.

"The effect of nature exposure, nature connectedness on mental well-being and ill-being in a general Chinese population","Liu, HX; Nong, HF; Ren, H; Liu, K","Exposure to nature is associated with various mental health benefits. Nature connectedness (NC), a psychological construct that measures individuals' subjective sense of connection to nature, is found to influence the relationship between nature exposure and mental health, including well-being and ill-being. However, studies from non-Western cultures have only examined either nature exposure and mental health or NC and mental health, with little research investigating the relationship among all three in a single study. Based on a face-to-face survey in Guangzhou (N = 863), this study investigates the relationship among nature exposure (greenspace visitation frequency, duration, and greenspace accessibility), NC, and mental well-being and ill-being. Based on the results, NC is stronger than nature exposure in predicting mental well-being, while greenspace visitation frequency and duration are stronger than NC in predicting ill-being. Having a higher-than-average NC is associated with a 7% increase in feelings of worthwhileness, a 6.4% increase in life satisfaction, and a 2.5% decrease in depression risk. NC could function as both mediator and moderator, depending on the specific nature exposure-mental health link examined. Future studies are required to understand the complex interaction of nature exposure, NC, and mental health. Our study indicates that a shift in policymaking to enhance NC is recommended to achieve the related psychological benefits. To this end, research on the influencing factors of NC (e.g., characteristics of nature experiences) and effective interventions to cultivate NC are required.",2022,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,222,,,WOS:000795155600002,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104397,,#2646,Liu 2022,
The Relationship between the Restorative Perception of the Environment and the Physiological and Psychological Effects of Different Types of Forests on University Students,"Liu, QH; Wang, XP; Liu, JL; Zhang, GL; An, CY; Liu, YQ; Fan, XL; Hu, YS; Zhang, H","Short-term exposure to a forest environment is beneficial to human physiological and psychological health. However, there is little known about the relationship between the restorative perception of environment and physiological and psychological restoration achieved by experiencing the forest environment. This study evaluated the relationship between the restorative perception of different types of forests and human physiological and psychological effects. A sample of 30 young adult students from Beijing Forestry University was exposed to coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forests as well as an urban site. Restorative perception of the environment was measured using the PRS questionnaire. Restorative effects were measured using physiological indicators (blood pressure and heart rate) and three psychological questionnaires (Restorative Outcome Scale; Subjective Vitality Scale; Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The results demonstrated the following: (1) There were significant differences in the perceived restorative power of the three types of forests, with the highest level in the mixed forest, followed by the coniferous forest and the deciduous forest. (2) All types of forests were beneficial to physiological and psychological restoration. The mixed forest had the greatest effect in lowering blood pressure and heart rate as well as increasing vitality, while the coniferous forest had the strongest increases in psychological restoration and positive mental health. (3) The level of perceived restorative power of environment was positively related to the physiological and psychological restoration.

Children and Nature: Linking Accessibility of Natural Environments and Children's Health-Related Quality of Life,"Tillmann, S; Clark, AF; Gilliland, JA","A growing body of research suggests that increasing children's nature interactions can have positive benefits for their health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, researchers have yet to examine how geographical context influences this relationship. The purpose of this study was to examine individual-level and environmental factors that are associated with HRQOL of children from different geographical contexts. Data were collected for 851 children from 34 elementary schools in Ontario, Canada. The natural environments around each child's home were computed using geospatial analyses in a geographic information system. Natural environment measures were combined with HRQOL and the demographics from child surveys to be used in a series of step-wise linear regression models. These models explored the relationship between children's HRQOL and the natural environment in urban/suburban and rural populations. In addition to important individual-level determinants, the findings revealed that characteristics of the natural environment, including the amount of greenness, park, and water, show significant relationships in the urban/suburban population. Interpersonal variables were the key predictors of HRQOL in the rural population. Where children live influences relationships between nature and HRQOL. These findings have implications for policymakers, health practitioners, educators, and parents in the design and the promotion of nature for children's HRQOL.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,15,6,,WOS:000436496900023,10.3390/ijerph15061072,,#2653,Tillmann 2018,
"Restorative effects of mature and young commercial forests, pristine old-growth forest and urban recreation forest - A field experiment","Simkin, J; Ojala, A; Tyrvainen, L","Urban and peri-urban forests and woodlands provide an important recreational service for citizens. However, these forests are facing increasing pressure due to the ongoing land-use encroachment and increased demands for wood-based products. Same time the world is getting more urbanized and living in cities is associated with mental health problems and exposure to air pollution and noise. Conversely, forests are known to create more healthy environments, and the need for effectively restorative forests is even more evident. In this study we investigated whether the restorative effects of forests on people vary according to the forests' different management decisions and/or ages. We selected four spruce-dominated forests that represent well the different management outcomes: 1) an urban recreation forest, 2) a mature commercial forest, 3) a young commercial forest, and 4) an old-growth forest in its natural state. The study participants (39 women and 27 men) visited each forest once. The experiment included 15 min of observation, followed by 30 min of walking. We measured the restorative effects: perceived restorative outcomes, vitality and positive and negative emotions. The restorative effects increased significantly in all forests. The old-growth forest and mature commercial forest were significantly most restorative. The urban recreation forest was less restorative than these two, but more restorative than the young commercial forest which was at least restorative. In conclusion, it is important to preserve forests with old stands close to residential areas. As the forest management decisions and stand age affect restorative qualities, they should be taken into account in forest management and land use planning.",2020,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,48,,,WOS:000512752000024,10.1016/j.ufug.2019.126567,,#2656,Simkin 2020,
Wellbeing and urban living: nurtured by nature,"Taylor, L; Hahs, AK; Hochuli, DF","In recent decades, empirical evidence has demonstrated that nature can enable urban environments to support human wellbeing. Research into links between nature and human wellbeing is often carried out with one wellbeing index or in single locations, which can limit our understanding of findings. To further this work, we deployed an online survey to residents of the two most-populous cities in both Australia and New Zealand. The survey measured self-reported wellbeing via three indices used widely in the literature: general wellbeing (WHO-5), personal wellbeing, and psychological wellbeing. We compared results with two biodiversity indicators: bird species richness and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of respondents' postcodes. We also asked respondents to rate the amount of nature they view from their immediate environment: both at home and at work or other frequent location. Our results support a link between local nature and human wellbeing across all four cities, significantly in the two Australian cities. Qualitative data reveals that urban life can challenge human wellbeing by creating a unique suite of stresses that residents strive to balance. There is the potential for nature to support human wellbeing in typically degraded urban environments. While this work corroborates existing literature demonstrating links between human wellbeing and nature, our qualitative research extends our understanding of these links by providing more detailed and nuanced information.",2018,,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,21,1,197-208,WOS:000424265800017,10.1007/s11252-017-0702-1,,#2661,Taylor 2018,
Residential greenness and indicators of stress and mental well-being in a Canadian national-level survey,"Crouse, DL; Pinault, L; Christidis, T; Lavigne, E; Thomson, EM; Villeneuve, PJ","Background: Residential proximity to greenness in urban areas has been shown to confer a number of health benefits, including improved mental health. We investigated whether greenness was associated with self reported stress, distress, and mental health among adult participants of multiple cycles of a national Canadian health survey, and whether these associations varied by sex, age, income, and neighbourhood characteristics.Methods: Our study population included 397,900 participants of the Canadian Community Health Survey, 18 years of age or older, who lived in census metropolitan areas between 2000 and 2015. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize participants' exposure to greenness within 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km buffers from a representative location of their postal code. Health outcomes included: self-reported perceptions of life stress, psychological distress, and self-rated mental health. We used multiple regression models, adjusted for relevant individual and neighbourhood-level variables to estimate associations (and 95% confidence intervals) between each outcome and exposure to greenness.Findings: In models with all participants, we observed 6% lower odds of poor self-rated mental health per increase in the interquartile range (i.e., 0.12) of NDVI within a 500 m buffer. Across the three outcomes, we found substantial heterogeneity in effect size across categories of sex, age, and community-level indicators of deprivation and urban form. For example, each incremental increase in greenness exposure was associated with a reduction of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.81 to-0.51) on the K10 psychological distress score among those living in the active core of cities, and with an increase of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.03-0.12) on this score among those living in the most suburban areas.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the potential benefits of residential greenness on mental health vary across personal and neighbourhood-level characteristics and are sensitive to how the outcome is measured.

Effects of urban parks on residents' expressed happiness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Cheng, YY; Zhang, JG; Wei, W; Zhao, B","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted human health worldwide. In these unprecedented times, the benefits of urban parks for residents have gained attention. However, few studies have explored the effects of urban parks on residents' expressed happiness from the perspective of big data, and fewer have further deciphered the disparities between residents' expressed happiness before and during the pandemic. In this study, we explored the effects of urban parks on residents' happiness by including nine independent factors in baseline regression models, and chose 577 urban parks in Nanjing City, China, as study sites. Around 600,000 geotagged posts crawled on Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) were employed to obtain residents' expressed happiness. The results demonstrated that residents with access to urban parks with higher normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) values are likely to be happier; and subdistrict-scale urban parks have the highest positive association with residents' expressed happiness. The presence of water, relatively dense populations, low land surface temperatures, and a low proportion of impervious land in the living environment were significantly associated with the higher expressed happiness of residents. The research period was divided into before and during the pandemic, and we identified that the positive association between NDVI of urban parks and residents' expressed happiness increased by one-half during the pandemic period compared to the overall results (0.372 vs. 0.255), indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic awakened Chinese residents' longing for high ""green quality"" urban parks.

Can Residential Greenspace Exposure Improve Pain Experience? A Comparison between Physical Visit and Image Viewing,"Li, HS; Zhang, X; Bi, SL; Cao, Y; Zhang, GD","Reducing the burden of pain via greenspace exposure is a rising research topic. However, insufficient evidence has been found in relation to the environmental effect itself. Residential greenspace, as a convenient but limited natural environment for urban dwellers, has benefits and services yet to be discovered. Therefore, the current study recruited 24 young adults to evaluate the effects of physical visit to, or image viewing of, residential greenspace on pain perception and related psychophysiological outcomes, via simulated pain. Pain threshold and tolerance were recorded via the level of pain stimuli, and pain intensity was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and two adjective pairs were employed to measure the state anxiety and subjective stress, respectively. Meanwhile, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure (BP) were measured to investigate physiological responses. Besides, Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE) was also employed to assess participants' preference regarding the experimental environments. The results revealed that visiting the greenspace significantly increased the pain threshold and tolerance, while no significant effect was observed for image viewing. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in pain-related psychophysiological indices between the experimental settings, but significantly negative associations were found between the scores of SBE and subjective stress and state anxiety. In conclusion, the current study brings experimental evidence of improving pain experience via residential greenspace exposure, while the related psychophysiological benefits require further investigation.",2021,,HEALTHCARE,9,7,,WOS:000676652400001,10.3390/healthcare9070918,,#2683,Li 2021,
Relationship between Long-Term Residential Green Exposure and Individuals' Mental Health: Moderated by Income Differences and Residential Location in Urban China,"Zhang, X; Zhou, SH; Lin, RP; Su, LL","Environmental health effects during urbanization have attracted much attention. However, knowledge is lacking on the relationship between long-term cumulative residential environment and health effects on individuals during rapid transformations in urban physical and social space. Taking Guangzhou, China, as a case example, this study analyzed the relationship between long-term exposure to green environments and residents' mental health under urban spatial restructuring. Based on a household survey in 2016, 820 residents who have lived in Guangzhou for more than 15 years were used as the sample. High-resolution remote sensing images were used to assess the long-term green exposure of residents. The results indicate that long-term green exposure in residential areas had a negative correlation with residents' mental health (p < 0.05), and the correlation was strongest for the cumulative green environment in the last five years. However, this significant effect was moderated by income and residential location. Green exposure had a positive relationship with mental health for low income groups, and a negative relationship for middle and high income groups. In addition, residents living farther away from the city center were likely to have fewer green environmental health benefits. Residential relocation in a rapidly urbanizing and transforming China has led to the continuous differentiation of residential green environments among different income groups, which has also caused different mental health effects from green exposure. It provides empirical evidence and theoretical support for policymakers to improve the urban environment and reduce environmental health disparities by considering social differences and residential location.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,17,23,,WOS:000597996000001,10.3390/ijerph17238955,,#2699,Zhang 2020,

The main objective for this study was to determine if stress-related illness rates in regions of Texas were related to vegetation rates and tree canopy cover. Data on the stress-related illnesses of high blood pressure and heart attacks were collected from the Center for Health Statistics and the Texas Department of State Health Services for all 25 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in Texas. MSAs are counties or group of counties with a central city or urbanized area of at least 50,000 people. Percent canopy cover was calculated for each MSA using the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics National Land Cover Data canopy cover dataset. Vegetation rates for all the MSAs were examined and mapped for illustration using geographical information system (GIS) software. Visual relationships among the data were observed. Quantitative data were also analyzed. When mapping stress-related illness rate into MSA regions of Texas, no clear trend was observed with vegetation rates or percent tree canopy cover when compared with stress-related illness rates. Semipartial correlations were calculated to analyze the relationship between tree canopy cover and vegetation rate and stress-related illness rate variables after controlling the effect of external variables like income levels, age, population, and ethnicity.

Cognitive-Emotional Benefits of Weekly Exposure to Nature: A Taiwanese Study on Young Adults,"Yeung, YY; Yu, CP","Empirical evidence of nature's benefits to cognitive and emotional well-being is emerging. In this study, 48 Taiwanese young adults (24 indoors and 24 outdoors in urban greenspace) completed four weekly 45 min exposure sessions. The study explores whether the outdoor group surpasses the indoor group in cognitive and emotional well-being and nature connectedness. There were no significant differences for the indoor group across different measurements of rumination and connectedness to nature. However, the outdoor group displayed a significant reduction in rumination post-test compared to the one week prior and the first session. Similarly, for sessions two, three, and four and one month post-test, the outdoor group's connectedness to nature was significantly higher than pre-test. Specific autobiographical memory was enhanced while overgeneral autobiographic memory was reduced during the third and fourth sessions, though these changes were not sustained at one-month follow-up. Surprisingly, both groups yielded similar results in decreased depression, anxiety, and stress. A significantly higher number of outdoor group participants had employed nature exposure for coping with stress or emotions after the program.

Findings from 496 Cities in the United States","Browning, MHEM; Rigolon, A","Examination of the greenspace human health relationship operates in at least four dimensions: what is considered greenspace? which moderators and mediators are included? what outcomes are measured? and which units of analysis (e.g., individuals, cities) are studied? We examined three of these four dimensions in a cross-sectional study of 496 of the 500 most populated US cities (total population size = 97,574,613, average population per city = 197,920). Spatial average models tested the effect of two greenspace measures (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index greenness and tree cover) on two outcomes (obesity and mental health), while adjusting for income, race and ethnicity, sprawl, age, sex, physical inactivity, median age of housing, and total population. We conducted analyses at the city scale, which is an understudied unit of analysis, and compared findings to individual- and neighborhood-level studies. In two of four models, greenspace was associated with better health. We found race and ethnicity moderated this relationship with varying results. In full sample analyses, cities with greater percentages of non-Hispanic Whites showed links between higher tree cover and lower obesity but marginal relationships between higher greenness and lower obesity. In subsample analyses with majority-non-Hispanic Black cities, higher tree cover was associated with lower obesity and better mental health. These findings advance previous research by showing that race and ethnicity moderate the greenspace health link at the city level.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,15,7,,WOS:000445543500248,10.3390/ijerph15071541,,#2766,Browning 2018,
Physical and mental health effects of repeated short walks in a blue space environment: A randomised crossover study,"Vert, C; Gascon, M; Ranzani, O; Marquez, S; Triguero-Mas, M; Carrasco-Turigas, G; Arjona, L; Koch, S; Llopis, M; Donaire-Gonzalez, D; Elliott, LR; Nieuwenhuijsen, M","Introduction: Blue spaces may benefit mental health and promote physical activity, although the evidence is still scarce. And benefits on physical health are less consistent. The objective of this randomized crossover study was to assess psychological and cardiovascular responses to blue spaces' exposure.Methods: A sample of 59 healthy adult office workers was randomly assigned to a different environment (i.e. blue space, urban space, and control site) on 4 days each week, for 3 weeks. For 20 min per day, they either walked along a blue or an urban space or rested at a control site. Before, during and/or after the exposure, we measured self-reported well-being and mood, blood pressure, and heart rate variability parameters. For well-being, we also assessed the duration of these potential effects over time (at least 4 h after exposure).Results: We found significantly improved well-being and mood responses immediately after walking in the blue space compared with walking in the urban space or when resting in the control site. Cardiovascular responses showed increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, both during and after walking along the blue and urban spaces. However, cardiovascular responses measured after the walks, showed no statistically significant differences between the blue and the urban space environments.Conclusions: Short walks in blue spaces can benefit both well-being and mood. However, we did not observe a positive effect of blue spaces for any of the cardiovascular outcomes assessed in this study.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,188,,,WOS:000564652400003,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109812,,#2783,Vert 2020,
Does happiness data say urban parks are worth it?,"Kim, D; Jin, J","Urban planners emphasize that urban nature plays an important role in providing social and psychological benefits to urban dwellers. Particularly, it provides space not only for the improvement of public health, but also for social interaction and community cohesion. However, less scientific attention has been paid to the effects of urban parks on the subjective well-being of urban dwellers who live in high density cities. In this study, we examine the relationship between individual subjective well-being and urban parks with individual survey data for self-reported happiness in Seoul. We obtain longitudinal Seoul Survey Data (SSD) conducted by the Seoul government between 2005 and 2015, and employ pooled cross-section data analysis with location-specific and time-specific fixed-effects to estimate the effects of urban parks on the subjective well-being of urban dwellers. In addition, we estimate the monetary value of urban parks using the average marginal rate of substitution between urban parks and household income. Our findings show that urban parks are associated with residents' subjective well-being. Specifically, on average, an individual household has an implicit willingness-to-pay of approximately 129,300 won (approximately 110 U.S. dollar) in monthly household income for a 100 m(2) increase in urban parks. High-income residents' willingness-to-pay is approximately seventeen times more than that of low-income residents. Seniors also have more willingness-to-pay for urban parks.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,178,,11-Jan,WOS:000442710400001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.05.010,,#2785,Kim 2018,

Connections Between Daily Greenness Exposure and Health Outcomes,"Jiang, XR; Larsen, L; Sullivan, W","A compelling body of research demonstrates that exposure to nature, especially trees, is beneficial to human health. We know little, however, about the extent to which understory vegetation that does not reach the height of trees, impacts human health. An additional gap in our knowledge concerns the extent to which daily variations in exposure to various forms of vegetation are related to human health outcomes. Many previous findings describing such connections were achieved in laboratory settings or through semi-controlled experiments, which do not reflect the dynamic variations of people's daily exposure to nature. Thus, we conducted an online survey to address these questions. We used the National Land Cover Dataset 2011 and Google Street View images to estimate participants' daily exposure to nature, and two standard questionnaires (General Health SF-12 and the Perceived Stress Scale) to assess health. Results show that greater exposure to trees in daily life is associated with better health outcomes. Specifically, higher neighborhood concentrations of tree canopy are related to better physical health, overall health and an increased capacity to control stress. In contrast, the results exploring the health associations of understory vegetation were inconsistent. In most cases, understory vegetation had a negative relationship with stress and mental health measures.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,17,11,,WOS:000542629600218,10.3390/ijerph17113965,,#2809,Jiang 2020,

The participants, 30-61-year-old healthy women (N = 83), visited each study site once. The experiment consisted of a 15-min viewing session, followed by a 30-min walking session in each environment. We measured restorative effects: perceived restorative outcomes, vitality, and blood pressure in these three environments. The data were analysed in SAS with a linear mixed model. We found significant differences between environments in psychological restorative effects, but not in blood pressure. The urban-nature orientedness, and to a lesser extent noise sensitivity, modified the effect of environment on restoration. In conclusion, individual characteristics affect psychological restoration provided by various urban environments.

The restorative outcomes of forest school and conventional school in young people with good and poor behaviour,"Roe, J; Aspinall, P","Research has shown that the context for psychological restoration and the amount of change can vary amongst adults with different mental health states. There is, however, little evidence of this process in young people. This paper reports on a study which compares the restorative outcomes for adolescents (aged 11) when spending time in an outdoor education setting (forest school) versus a conventional indoor school setting. The adolescents differed across a behavioural spectrum from 'good' to 'poor' behaviour (n = 18). Two aspects of restoration are examined, firstly mood (measuring energy, stress, anger and hedonic tone), the other. reflection on personal goals using personal project techniques (Little, 1983) to capture this. Results from repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on each of the emotional variables showed a number of significant effects with - in each case - greater positive change in the forest setting. There were additional significant behavioural effects with those with poor behaviour benefiting most from the forest school experience. This study extends restorative environments research by showing the amount of change and context for restoration can vary amongst young people with different behaviour states. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

"Closure of view to the urban matrix has positive effects on perceived restorativeness in urban forests in Helsinki, Finland","Hauru, K; Lehvavirta, S; Korpela, K; Kotze, DJ","We studied the restorative potential of fragmented urban forests in Helsinki, Finland. Our aim was to explore how perceived restorativeness (PR) in urban forests changes when exposed to different levels of urbanity observed through the forest vegetation from the viewpoint of the forest interior. The level of PR was measured in forests that bordered either housing or a road. Three sampling points were selected within each forest, which included (1) an open view (at the edge), (2) a semi-closed view (at the edge zone), and (3) a closed view (in the forest interior) to the urban matrix. We hypothesized that the less urban matrix is observed through the forest vegetation from within the forest, the higher PR would be, and that PR is higher in forests bordering housing than in forests bordering roads. Results supported our hypotheses, as PR was higher inside forests with a closed view to the urban matrix compared to semi-closed and open views. PR was also higher in forests bordering housing than forests bordering a road, albeit not statistically significantly so. We conclude that in order to enhance the restorative potential of an urban forest, planners and managers should preserve sufficiently large forest patches with forest interior habitats, or promote the growth of dense and multilayered vegetation to restrict visibility to the urban matrix.

Psychological Wellbeing Benefits of Simulated Exposure to Five Urban Settings: an Experimental Study From the Pedestrian's Perspective,"Bornioli, A; Parkhurst, G; Morgan, PL","The potential health benefits of walking in attractive, predominantly built-up urban settings have not received much attention from scholars, despite the global need to increase walking levels in cities. The current experimental study assessed the affective outcomes associated with several urban walking settings, with a focus on the presence of motor-traffic and architectural styles from different historic periods. We employed a mixed within-between subjects design (n = 269) with employees and students from Bristol (UK) and measured relaxation and hedonic tone experiences, perceived restorativeness, and environmental perceptions following exposures to one of five urban settings. Results identified three categories of affective outcomes, rather than the classic dichotomy 'urban vs natural': the simulated walks in areas with greenery rated significantly better than the others; however, the pedestrianised settings were associated with neutral or positive affective outcomes and perceptions, with statistically significant differences with an area with traffic. These results suggest that walking in high-quality urban settings can have positive outcomes, and highlight the negative role of traffic and the potential benefits of historic elements in the affective walking experience. From a policy perspective, the findings strengthen the case for traffic removal, and indicate that exposure to high quality urban design that includes some natural elements can offer the same affective benefits offered by large green spaces.",2018,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,9,,105-116,WOS:000437100900014,10.1016/j.jth.2018.02.003,,#2853,Bornioli 2018,

Although nature experience has been shown to be positively associated with life satisfaction, it remains unknown whether the diversity of nature experiences contributes to increased life satisfaction and whether the relationship is mediated by a person's strength of connection with nature. We conducted a national survey in Singapore through online questionnaires (n = 1, 262), where we measured frequency, duration, diversity of nature experiences, and presence or absence of nature views from windows at home and at the workplace. We also measured participants' strength of connection with nature (how strongly a person identifies with nature). We found that people who visited more diverse types of natural spaces (ranging from wild nature, managed parks, and beaches) had higher life satisfaction. The presence of nature views from windows at the home and/or at the workplace was also linked with higher life satisfaction. We also found that people with a stronger connection with nature had higher life satisfaction when they spent more than one hour in natural spaces per week, while this relationship was weak for people without a strong connection with nature.

Study 1 exposed participants to outdoor (natural) or indoor settings, Study 2 repeated the design with photographs of the two settings, and Study 3 directly contrasted actual contact with pictures of nature. The pattern of mood scores across the three studies suggest that both actual and pictorial nature contact benefits moods, but actual nature is more effective.

Moving beyond the neighborhood: Daily exposure to nature and adolescents' mood,"Li, DY; Deal, B; Zhou, XL; Slavenas, M; Sullivan, WC","A growing body of literature has explored the psychological benefits associated with contact with nature. Many studies have employed experimental designs that compared various levels of nature exposure, or have used exogenous neighborhood-based measures of nature. The exact places where adolescents visit, as well as their street-level experiences with nature, remain unexplored. As a result, we know very little about the extent to which adolescents' actual exposure to nature is related to their moods. In this study, we examined the daily activities and moods of 155 adolescents from central Illinois to understand the association between exposure to varying concentrations of nature and adolescents' mood. Each participant wore a Global Positioning System (GPS) device for four consecutive days and completed an adapted Profile of Mood States questionnaire at the end of each day. We calculated the concentration of nature participants were exposed to by assessing the Google Street View images at the locations they visited throughout each day. Multi-level modeling analysis revealed significant associations between the concentration of nature and daily mood in participating adolescents, even after controlling for infra-individual and inter-individual level confounding variables. This relationship did not vary by demographic or socio-economic background. We discuss the implications for greening urban public space and resurrecting time for adolescents to engage in unstructured activities.

Mental state, attention capacity and preferences for different forest environments were studied during the forest visits. Mental state was improved, but it showed some seasonal differences. A significant effect on attention capacity was found for single forest visits, but there was no effect found for the rehabilitation period as a whole.

Planning for restorative forests: describing stress-reducing qualities of forest stands using available forest stand data,"Stoltz, J; Lundell, Y; Skarback, E; van den Bosch, MA; Grahn, P; Nordstrom, EM; Dolling, A","Research suggests that certain forest environments can contribute to lower stress levels in humans. This might be increasingly important to consider given the rising prevalence of stress-related diseases and illness absence. To make it feasible to plan for forest management strategies that take such restorative effects into account, it would seem to be important to identify the precise physical properties that contribute to the restorative qualities of forest stands. It would also be useful if forest stand data typically already collected by forest owners could be used for this purpose. In the present study, forest stands in northern, central, and southern Sweden were visited and assessed regarding their restorative potential. These assessments were analysed together with available forest stand data for each region using statistical models. Our results indicate that of the available forest stand data parameters, the most important individual indicators of forest stands' restorative qualities were tree age, tree sparsity, and tree height. Models based on these parameters explained 30-40 % of the variation in restorative qualities among the evaluated stands, indicating that they can be useful in planning and modelling scenarios where restorative properties of forest stands are considered.",2016,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,135,5,803-813,WOS:000384571700001,10.1007/s10342-016-0974-7,,#2900,Stoltz 2016,
Impact of views to school landscapes on recovery from stress and mental fatigue,"Li, DY; Sullivan, WC","Previous research has demonstrated positive associations between the greenness of high school landscapes and school wide academic performance. We do not known, however, if green landscapes cause better performance or if the association between the two is a product of self-selection. If there is a causal relationship, the pathways through which green school landscapes affect student performance remain unclear. We hypothesize that views onto green landscapes help students recover from mental fatigue and stress. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment with 94 high school students at five high schools. Participants were randomly assigned to classrooms without windows or with windows that opened onto a built space or a green space. Participants engaged in typical classroom activities followed by a break in the classroom to which they were assigned. Attentional functioning was measured using Digit Span Forward and Backwards. Physiological stress levels were measured by skin conductance, body temperature, pNN50 (the proportion of the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms divided by the total number of NNs) and LF/HF (the ratio between low-frequency peak and high frequency peak). Results demonstrate that classroom views to green landscapes cause significantly better performance on tests of attention and increase student's recovery from stressful experiences. A lack of mediation effect demonstrates that attention restoration and stress recovery are two distinct processes. Implications for school site selection, design and renovation are discussed.

We analyzed the restorative influence on mood states and situational stress related to exposure to vegetation proportion, spatial extension, landmark salience, biophilic architecture, people density, street visual access, olfactory pleasantness, and noise of 65 public spaces in a Mexican city. The environmental qualities of these places were analyzed with multidimensional scaling (MDS), leading to eight space categories (e.g., historic squares with biophilic architecture, large parks, street scenes, and interiors with non-biophilic architecture). Ratings of the restorative potential, mood states, situational stress, olfactory pleasantness, and noise annoyance were evaluated on such places and modeled through a structural equation modeling (SEM). The model shows that the restorative influence of the environmental qualities on moods and stress was related to a decrease in experiences of negative moods and perceived stress, and an increase of positive mood states.

However, there is little empirical evidence on the impact of outdoor play spaces on childhood mental and behavioral health. To fill this gap, we investigated the associations between residential proximity to outdoor play spaces and the prevalence of diagnosed mental and behavioral disorders. We explored whether these associations differ by individual and area-level socioeconomic status (SES). This cross-sectional study included 151 110 children who were 0-12 years old in 2014 and were visited in public primary health care centers in Barcelona (Spain). Each child's demographic and mental and behavioral disorders information was extracted for 2005-2014, including diagnoses on disorders of psychological development together with other four types of mental and behavioral disorders. The pediatrician diagnosed mental and behavioral disorders we explored in this study were: mood/affective; neurotic, stressrelated and somatoform; psychological development; behavioral and emotional; and overall mental and behavioral disorders. We assessed 300 m network buffer residential proximity to overall outdoor play spaces (i.e., the overall sum of play spaces of any type), outdoor green play spaces, and to a diversity of outdoor play spaces. We used robust Poisson regression models to investigate the association between proximity to outdoor play spaces indicators and each health outcome. We tested interaction terms for indicators of proximity to outdoor play spaces and individual and area SES. For measures with significant interaction terms, we conducted stratified models. We found residential proximity to outdoor play spaces to be protective of disorders of psychological development.

Green Breaks: The Restorative Effect of the School Environment's Green Areas on Children's Cognitive Performance,"Amicone, G; Petruccelli, I; De Dominicis, S; Gherardini, A; Costantino, V; Perucchini, P; Bonaiuto, M","Restoration involves individuals' physical, psychological, and social resources, which have diminished over the years in the process of meeting the demands of everyday life. Psychological restoration can be provided by specific environments, in particular by natural environments. Studies report a restorative effect of nature on human beings, specifically in terms of the psychological recovery from attention fatigue and restored mental resources that were previously spent in activities that require attention. Two field studies in two Italian primary schools tested the hypothesized positive effect of recess time spent in a natural (vs. built) environment on pupils' cognitive performance and their perceived restorativeness, using standardized tests. In Study 1, children's psychological restoration was assessed by measuring sustained and selective attention, working memory, and impulse control, before and after the morning recess time. Team standardized playtime was conducted in a natural (vs. built) environment, and the perceived restorativeness was measured after each recess time. Results showed a greater increase in sustained and selective attention, concentration, and perceived restorativeness from pretest to posttest after the natural environment condition. In Study 2, the positive effect of free play recess time in a natural (vs. built) environment was assessed during the afternoon school time on sustained and selective attention and perceived restorativeness. Results showed an increase in sustained and selective attention after the natural environment condition (vs. built) and a decrease after the built environment break. Higher scores in perceived restorativeness were registered after the natural (vs. built) environment condition. Team standardized playtime and individual free play recess in a natural environment (vs. built) support pupils' attention restoration during both morning and afternoon school times, as well as their perceived restorativeness of the recess environment.

Green and blue settings as providers of mental health ecosystem services: Comparing urban beaches and parks and building a predictive model of psychological restoration,"Subiza-Perez, M; Vozmediano, L; San Juan, C","Urban beaches and parks are providers of numerous ecosystem services. In the cultural sphere, place bonding and psychological restoration might significantly contribute to the health and well-being of citizens. In this manuscript, we present a study aimed to evaluate the extent to which three urban beaches and three urban parks offered these advantages to a sample of users (n = 429) in the city of Donostia-San Sebastian (Spain). A second aim was to build a predictive model of restoration through both objective and subjective measures. We assessed the design and physical features of the settings using the Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST) and gathered a range of information about the users via a paper & pencil questionnaire. The survey included socio-demo-graphics, questions regarding the frequency and patterns of use, and four different psycho-environmental scales: Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), Place Attachment and Identification Scale, and Restoration Outcome Scales (ROS). We found differences regarding the profile of users and the activities carried out in each of the settings. Users of beaches reported higher levels of attachment, identification, and experienced restoration than the participants surveyed in urban parks (p < .001). Regression analyses revealed that the main predictors of experienced restoration where perceived restorativeness (beta = 0.49), attachment (beta = 0.22), and identification (beta = 0.15), whereas the physical/design features of the environment and the routines of use made a negligible contribution in this regard. The results of the regression analyses were extended by conducting dominance and relative weight analyses.",2020,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,204,,,WOS:000579383300005,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103926,,#2935,Subiza-Perez 2020,
On pathways and agreement: Objective and perceived accounts of neighbourhood attributes and their associations with mental health during pregnancy,"Subiza-Perez, M; Anabitarte, A; Babarro, I; Jimeno-Romero, A; Delclos, C; Vich, G; Delclos-Alio, X; Rueda-Garcia, C; Miralles-Guasch, C; Lertxundi, A","There is growing interest in understanding the links between neighbourhood environmental attributes (i.e. greenness, walkability and air pollution) and human health. Recent research has analysed the mediating role of a diverse set of potential factors and studied the agreement between objective and perceived modalities of those attributes. In this study, we explored the connections between objective neighbourhood attributes, their perceived accounts and mental health during pregnancy, using a measure of social cohesion as potential mediator with data from two samples of pregnant women recruited during the 12th week of pregnancy in two Spanish cities (Donostialdea, n = 440; Barcelona n = 364). Besides, we ran analyses on the agreement between objective and perceived measures. We fitted four separate Structural Equation Models and detected associations between objective neighbourhood attributes and mental health occurred only through their perceived coun-terparts and the strengthening of social cohesion. We also found poor to fair agreement between greenness measures in both cities, walkability measures only in Donostialdea, and were unable to detect any meaningful agreement between air pollution variables. Using rescaled versions of neighbourhood attribute variables and in some instances, we saw that the higher the objective value of a given attribute, the larger the differences between objective and perceived accounts of such attributes.",2023,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,230,,,WOS:000879887100002,10.1016/j.lurbplan.2022.104612,,#2955,Subiza-Perez 2023,
"There's no place like home? The psychological, physiological, and cognitive effects of short visits to outdoor urban environments compared to staying in the indoor home environment, a field experiment on women from two ethnic groups","Saadi, D; Schnell, I; Tirosh, E; Basagana, X; Agay-Shay, K","Background: The home environment is regarded as a safe, comfortable environment, however, home can also be a stressful place. Compared to staying in the indoor home environment, the effects of short visits to outdoor urban environments on short-term psychological, physiological and cognitive responses were not studied previously.Aim: To evaluate whether visits to different urban and ethnic environments, in comparison to staying in the home indoor environment, leads to short-term changes in psychological, physiological and cognitive responses and whether these responses are independent of ethnicity.Methods: The participants, 20-35 year-old healthy women (N = 72, 48 Arab and 24 Jewish), started the experiment at their home and visited six different outdoor urban environments in predominantly ethnic Arab or Jewish cities, in Israel. First they visited intra-ethnic city and afterward inter-ethnic city environments. In each city they first visited an urban park and afterward, in a random order, a residential neighborhood and the city center. In each environment (including home) the following measures were used to evaluate psychological, physiological and cognitive effects: mood (measured as positive and negative emotions, cheerfulness, relaxed, natural and discomfort feelings), autonomic nervous system balance (assessed using heart rate variability (HRV)) and working memory (measured by a backwards digit-span task). Several potential mediators were measured: carbon monoxide (CO), heat, noise, social aspects, and the self-perceived restoration scale.Results: Compared to staying in the indoor home environment, short visits to outdoor urban environments, specifically intra and inter-ethnic parks, were associated with beneficial psychological, physiological, and cognitive responses, and the strongest effects were found for the intra-ethnic park. The results for the other urban environments were different between Jewish and Arab women. The self-perceived restoration, social aspects and reduced CO, heat and noise exposures during the visits did not explain the observed changes between the outdoor environments and home.Conclusions: Visits to urban parks compared to staying in the home environment had beneficial short-term changes in psychological, physiological, and cognitive responses, regardless of ethnicity. The changes could not be attributed to the investigated mediators. Women should be encouraged to go outdoors and specifically visit parks to improve their psychological and physiological health.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,187,,,WOS:000541251900067,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109687,,#2998,Saadi 2020,
Quality of life: The perspective of urban park recreation in three Asian cities,"Li, CL","Health and wellness is an important research topic in the area of parks, recreation, and tourism. Previous research has suggested that green spaces such as urban parks are associated with people's health and wellness, including their quality of life (QOL). Despite a recent proliferation of research on QOL and well-being in parks, recreation, and tourism, little has been conducted in a cross-cultural context. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between the 26-item WHOQOL-BREF scale and demographics and behavioral variables among urban park users from three cities: Jakarta, Indonesia, Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan. In 2016, an on-site systematic selection sampling approach was employed and 608 useful surveys were obtained from park users. Two hierarchical exploratory factor analyses and a reliability analysis were employed to find interpretable dimensions of QOL in the context of urban parks and recreation. The results revealed a three-factor solution. The first factor, life satisfaction, had six items; the second, physical condition, had three items; and the third, self-satisfaction, contained three items. These factors were verified and tested with a sequence of demographics and behavioral variables. The results demonstrated that QOL was significantly related to the demographics and behavioral variables. The findings have implications for management and policymaking in urban parks and recreation. Managers may tailor their services to enhance QOL according to the diverse backgrounds of urban inhabitants and park users. Discussion and suggestions for future research are also provided.Management implications: The dimensions and factor patterns describing the role of parks for the quality of life cannot be transferred from urban parks in North America to Asian cities such as Jakarta, Seoul or Taipei. The comparison reveals significant cultural differences even between these three cities.Park managers need to consider a heterogeneous profile of urban park users. The findings suggest that frequency of visit and length of stay have positive effects on the self-reported quality of life.",2020,,JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,29,,,WOS:000519246500011,10.1016/j.jort.2019.100260,,#3001,Li 2020,
An investigation into the synergistic wellbeing benefits of greenspace and physical activity: Moving beyond the mean,"Ambrey, CL","The purpose of this study is to shed light on: (1) how greenspace and physical activity, independent of any synergy, are heterogeneously linked across the distribution of wellbeing; and also (2) how the potential synergies between greenspace and physical activity might have heterogeneous impacts across the distribution of wellbeing. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey and data from Geographic Information Systems this study finds, for the case of major Australian cities, that greenspace and physical activity are independently positively associated with life satisfaction, mental health and negatively associated with psychological distress. A finding which is stronger for physical activity than it is for greenspace. Across measures of life satisfaction, mental health and psychological distress, the results lend support to the hypothesis that physical activity may be relatively more effective at mitigating the likelihood of experiencing a serious dearth of wellbeing, compared to promoting higher levels of wellbeing. Unexpectedly, the results do not provide support for the hypothesised greenspace-physical activity synergy. A result found to be common across the wellbeing distribution. While further research is required to draw a definitive conclusion, this result may indicate that physical activity is simply not conducive to the realisation of the restorative benefits of exposure to nature, and the other co-benefits of 'green exercise'. In all, the findings presented in this study add to the existing stock of knowledge from a socialecological perspective and also raise new questions for future research. The results presented in this study may also prove useful to policy makers wrestling with the challenges of maintaining or improving residents' wellbeing and reducing residents' ill-being in the face of continuing population growth and declining per capita greenspace.

"A one-hour walk in nature reduces amygdala activity in women, but not in men","Sudimac, S; Kuhn, S","Urban dwellers are more likely to develop mental disorders such as mood and anxiety disorder as well as schizophrenia compared to rural dwellers. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that even short-term exposure to nature can improve mood and decrease stress, but the underlying neural mechanisms are currently under investigation. In the present intervention study we examined the effects of a one-hour walk in an urban vs. natural environment on activity in the amygdala, a brain region previously associated with stress processing. Before and after the walk 63 participants underwent an fMRI paradigm inducing social stress. Since there is a pronounced gap in the literature regarding interindividual differences in stress-related neural effects of urban and natural environments, we set out to explore sex differences. We observed that amygdala activity decreased after the walk in nature, but only in women, suggesting that women may profit more from salutogenic effects of nature. Moreover, performance on the arithmetic tasks improved in women after the walk in nature, whereas men performed better after the walk in the urban environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report differencial tendencies in men and women concerning the stress-related neural activity as an effect of acute exposure to urban vs. natural environments. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of sex differences when exploring effects of the environment on brain function and stress. Evidence for beneficial effects of nature on stress-related brain regions may inform urban design policies to focus on providing more accessible green areas in cities and this study suggests that sex differences in experiencing the environment should be taken into consideration.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,13,,,WOS:000868209400001,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.931905,,#3055,Sudimac 2022,
When Urban Environment Is Restorative: The Effect of Walking in Suburbs and Forests on Psychological and Physiological Relaxation of Young Polish Adults,"Janeczko, E; Bielinis, E; Wojcik, R; Woznicka, M; Kedziora, W; Lukowski, A; Elsadek, M; Szyc, K; Janeczko, K","Background and Objectives: Physical activity, recreation and walks successfully counteract negative symptoms of stress in people, especially in large cities, and have many positive psychological and physiological effects. There are many studies showing that contact with nature plays an important role in the regeneration of the human body. The city is not without green enclaves such as forests, parks or greenery along the streets. However, it is not entirely clear how the different physical characteristics of the urban space affect mood improvement, increase of positive feelings, vitality level, etc. Materials and Methods: In the study, two urban environments (apartment and green suburbs) were used, as well as two forests (coniferous and deciduous) to measure the impact of these environments on human physiological and psychological relaxation during a walk in a randomized experiment. The participants of the experiment were 75 young adult Poles studying in the largest Polish agglomeration, Warsaw. Before each experiment, the physiological and psychological state of the participant was measured indoors (pre-test). Four psychological questionnaires were used in the project (Profile of Mood States; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; Restorative Outcome Scale; Subjective Vitality Scale), and physiological measurements (heart rate, blood pressure) before and after the short walking program were evaluated. Results: As a result of the analyses, it was shown that both staying in an urban environment with greenery and staying in a forest environment have a positive effect on the physiological and psychological relaxation of the subjects. A short walk in the suburbs was no less attractive than a walk in the forest in fall. The above indicates that various places with urban vegetation can be successfully used for recreation, just as in a forest where forest bathing is practiced. This indicates that different places with urban greenery can be successfully used for recreation, as can the forests where forest bathing is carried out.",2020,,FORESTS,11,5,,WOS:000542736000056,10.3390/f11050591,,#3057,Janeczko 2020,
Effects of tree canopy on psychological distress: A repeated cross-sectional study before and during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Zhang, C; Wang, C; Chen, C; Tao, LY; Jin, JL; Wang, ZY; Jia, BQ","Background: During the COVID-19 epidemic period, people showed a stronger connection to the environment within their communities. Although tree canopy in residential areas has been shown to positively affect psychological distress, it is not clear whether the COVID-19 epidemic played a role in this process. Elucidation of the relationship between tree canopy and the impact on psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic could provide valuable information as to the best methods to help individuals cope with urban mental stress events.Methods: A total of 15 randomly selected residential areas of Beijing were enrolled in this repeated cross-sectional study. A total of 900 residents were included in the two-waves of the investigation (450 residents per wave) before and during the COVID-19 epidemic (i.e., May 2019 and May 2020). Psychological distress was estimated using the 12-question General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Tree canopy coverage (TCC) was measured through visual interpretation based on the 2013 data sources (World View 2 satellite imagery of Beijing urban areas with a resolution of 0.5 m). The demographic characteristics, distance to the nearest surrounding green or blue space, residential area house price, household density, and construction year were also collected in this study. A multivariate logistic regression, relative risk due to interaction (RERI), and synergy index (SI) were used to explore the relationships among tree canopy, COVID-19, and psychological distress.Results: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health was significant, with the prevalence of psychological distress increased 7.84 times (aOR = 7.84, 95% CI = 4.67-13.95) during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Tree canopy coverage in the group without psychological distress was significantly higher than that of the psychologically distressed group (31.07 +/- 11.38% vs. 27.87 +/- 12.97%, P = 0.005). An increase in 1% of TCC, was related to a 5% decrease in the prevalence of psychological distress (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93-0.98). An antagonism joint action between tree canopy and the COVID-19 epidemic existed (RERI = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.72-1.47; SI = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.52), and persisted enhancing only in medium (26.45%-33.21%) and above TCC level. Correlation of GHQ items and TCC significantly differed between the COVID-19 non-epidemic and epidemic periods, with the effects of tree canopy on GHQ-12 items covering topics, such as social function and depression, presumably absent because of epidemic limitations.Conclusions: This study indicates that the COVID-19 epidemic harmed mental health and verified the positive effects of residential tree canopy on psychological distress in Beijing. We suggest paying more attention to residents in areas of low TCC and dealing with psychological distress caused by public health stress events based on tree canopy strategies.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,203,,,WOS:000707122400008,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111795,,#3082,Zhang 2022,
Green environment and incident depression in South Africa: a geospatial analysis and mental health implications in a resource-limited setting,"Tomita, A; Vandormael, AM; Cuadros, D; Di Minin, E; Heikinheimo, V; Tanser, F; Slotow, R; Burns, JK","Background Unprecedented levels of habitat transformation and rapid urbanisation are changing the way individuals interrelate with the natural environment in developing countries with high economic disparities. Although the potential benefit of green environments for mental health has been recognised, population-level evidence to this effect is scarce. We investigated the effect of green living environment in potentially countering incident depression in a nationally representative survey in South Africa.Methods We used panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study ( SA-NIDS). Our study used SA-NIDS data from three waves: wave 1 (2008), wave 2 (2010), and wave 3 (2012). Households were sampled on the basis of a stratified two-stage cluster design. In the first stage, 400 primary sampling units were selected for inclusion. In the second stage, two clusters of 12 dwelling units each were drawn from within each primary sampling unit (or 24 dwelling units per unit). Household and individual adult questionnaires were administered to participants. The main outcome, incident depression (ie, incident cohort of 11 156 study participants without significant depression symptoms at their first entry into SA-NIDS), was assessed in the adult survey via a ten item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; a total score of ten or higher was used as a cutoff to indicate significant depressive symptoms. Each participant was assigned a value for green living space via a satellite-derived normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the GPS coordinates of their household location.Findings Overall, we found uneven benefit of NDVI on incident depression among our study participants. Although the green living environment showed limited benefit across the study population as a whole, our final analysis based on logistic regression models showed that higher NDVI was a predictor of lower incident depression among middle-income compared with low-income participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.98, 0.97-0.99, p<0.0001), although when this analysis was broken down by race, its positive effect was particularly evident amongst African individuals. Living in rural areas was linked to lower odds of incident depression (aOR 0.71, 0.55-0.92, p=0.011) compared with study participants residing in urban informal areas that often lack formal planning.Interpretation Our results imply the importance of green environments for mental wellbeing in sub-Saharan African settings experiencing rapid urbanisation, economic and epidemiological transition, reaffirming the need to incorporate environmental services and benefits for sustainable socioeconomic development.

"Eviction from paradise: Lived experience, psycho-social and health effects of allotment garden loss","Young, C; Bauer, N","This mixed-methods paper examines the experience and effects of the loss of an allotment garden among gar-deners in Zurich, Switzerland. The paper explores the subjective experience of garden loss using qualitative material gathered in field conversations with gardeners from an allotment area which was soon to be cleared for construction. In parallel, gardeners from the same area were surveyed before (2018) and after (2019) the clearance, thus constructing a natural experiment to measure effects on gardeners' social networks, social sup-port and general and mental health.The analysis of the qualitative material shows the (imminent) loss of the garden was a distressing experience for most participants, a result which is strongly supported by the descriptive analysis of several survey questions. Analysis of the quantitative data with ANCOVA models gives support to a negative effect of garden loss on the number of social contacts and on emotional well-being, but not on other factors.The experience of garden loss shows strong parallels to that of loss of a home, but also differs from it in relevant ways. Improved designs of similar natural experiments could lead to more reliable results.

The benefits of nature experience: Improved affect and cognition,"Bratman, GN; Daily, GC; Levy, BJ; Gross, JJ","This study investigated the impact of nature experience on affect and cognition. We randomly assigned sixty participants to a 50-min walk in either a natural or an urban environment in and around Stanford, California. Before and after their walk, participants completed a series of psychological assessments of affective and cognitive functioning. Compared to the urban walk, the nature walk resulted in affective benefits (decreased anxiety, rumination, and negative affect, and preservation of positive affect) as well as cognitive benefits (increased working memory performance). This study extends previous research by demonstrating additional benefits of nature experience on affect and cognition through assessments of anxiety, rumination, and a complex measure of working memory (operation span task). These findings further our understanding of the influence of relatively brief nature experiences on affect and cognition, and help to lay the foundation for future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects.

Wetland areas' direct contributions to residents' well-being entitle them to high cultural ecosystem values,"Pedersen, E; Weisner, SEB; Johansson, M","Wetlands in urban areas will be crucial to counteract the effects of climate change, for example, by improving flood protection and regulating local climate. To gain acceptance for larger-scale creation of wetlands, total values must be identified and revealed. Provisioning and regulating ecosystem services can be described as the quantitative effect, but cultural ecosystem services require other assessments. This study sought to determine whether peri-urban and urban wetland areas contribute to the well-being and quality of life of nearby residents, and to capture their value relative to two other types of green areas (i.e., parks and urban forests). A postal questionnaire survey, based on validated environmental psychology instruments, was distributed to residents in three municipalities with wetland areas of different structures and locations. In these municipalities, respondents (n = 474; response rate = 40%) reported that the wetland area contributed to several quality-of-life aspects, such as encountering nature and experiencing beauty. The areas also facilitated activities that support well-being, were perceived to have high restorative qualities, and evoked positive affective responses. All wetland areas were rated high on most of the measured concepts, but their value relative to other green areas differed possibly depending on the accessibility of the wetland and the availability of other green areas. The location and extent to which the wetland area was integrated in the residential area determined what quality-of-life aspects were most satisfied. Wetland areas can be ascribed cultural ecosystem service values based on how residents perceive their contribution to their quality of life. These values can be added to those of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, forming the basis for planning urban environments. (C) 2018 The Authors.

"Effects of Three Levels of Green Exercise, Physical and Social Environments, Personality Traits, Physical Activity, and Engagement with Nature on Emotions and Attention","Han, KT","The current study examined the effects of the three levels of green exercise on people's psychological health using a randomized trial with a pretest and posttest design and further explored which variables of the physical environment (thermal comfort, noise, and air pollution), social environment (the number of companions and crowdedness), personality traits, physical activity (intensity and frequency), and engagement with nature may help explain experiences during the three levels of green exercise using a cross-sectional approach. Field studies were conducted to test the study's hypotheses. The participants were 95 students from a technology university in Taiwan. The experiment comprised a 15-min green exercise in a park. No significant differences were found in emotions and attention between the three levels of green exercise. However, a 15-min green exercise of any level significantly improved emotions and attention. Furthermore, fatigue was significantly and negatively associated with daily transportation-related physical activity, agreeableness, and engagement with nature. Moreover, the total mood disturbance was significantly and negatively associated with engagement with nature and daily transportation-related physical activity. The degree of engagement with nature played a pivotal role in green exercise.

How do people feel while walking in the city? Using walking-triggered e-diaries to investigate the association of social interaction and environmental greenness during everyday life walking,"Bollenbach, L; Schmitz, J; Niermann, C; Kanning, M","BackgroundLight to moderate physical activity, which includes walking, is associated with positive effects on physical and mental health. However, concerning mental health, social and physical environmental factors are likely to play an important role in this association. This study investigates person-place interactions between environmental characteristics (greenness, social interaction) and momentary affective states during walking episodes. A within-subject design is implemented, in which affective states and environmental characteristics are assessed while participants are walking outside. MethodsOn smartphones, coupled with a motion sensor (move3), e-diaries were triggered as soon as people walked 100 m outside. E-diaries assessed momentary affective states (valence, calmness, energetic arousal), and social interaction (walking alone; seeing other people while walking; interacting with other people; walking with a known person) between 6 am and 10 pm over nine days. The percentage of greenness was determined afterward from recorded GPS and GIS data. Demographics were collected in advance via an online questionnaire. Multilevel models were calculated with R for 46 individuals (age = 41.2, +/- 13.2; 52% female). ResultsAffective state dimension energetic arousal showed a significant association with social interaction and greenness, i.e., participants rated energetic arousal lower when walking alone, and if there was less greenness vs. when interacting shortly with someone while walking (beta = 0.13, p = 0.02), and being in situations with more greenness (beta = 0.08, p = 0.02). Furthermore, associations with social interaction and greenness were found for dimension calmness: walking together with someone was associated with higher calmness (beta = 0.16, p = 0.02), and the higher the proportion of surrounding greenness during a walk, the higher calmness was rated, i.e., participants were calmer (beta = 0.09, p = 0.01). Significant associations with valence were not present. ConclusionThe findings indicate that the affective states varied significantly due to different social and physical environmental factors. In the future, the importance of environmental factors should be further investigated, e.g., by assessing environmental factors right in situations contrary to a subsequent imputation.

'This Is What the Colour Green Smells Like!': Urban Forest Bathing Improved Adolescent Nature Connection and Wellbeing,"McEwan, K; Potter, V; Kotera, Y; Jackson, JE; Greaves, S","Background: Research suggests that an early connection with nature can benefit wellbeing into adulthood. However, there is less research assessing whether adolescents benefit from formal nature connection interventions such as forest bathing (slow mindful nature walks). This research aimed to assess whether an urban nature connection intervention (called ParkBathe) could improve adolescents' nature connection and wellbeing. Method: In an experimental repeated measures design, 44 adolescents sampled opportunistically from Scouts groups, completed surveys and interviews before and after experiencing an urban nature connection intervention. Results: Paired-samples t-tests between baseline and post-intervention survey scores revealed statistically significant improvements in anxiety (13% reduction); rumination (44% reduction); scepticism (17% reduction); nature connection (25% increase); and social connection (12% increase). The largest effect size was found for nature connection. Interviews revealed that before the session, participants had a mixed understanding and expectations of the intervention. Conclusions: After the session, the participants expressed enjoying the social aspects of being part of a group and being present in the moment by noticing nature.

Although studies suggest city-level characteristics hold independent influence on QoL, they generally lack a theoretically informed approach to understanding how the whole city landscape might be implicated, have paid scant attention to inequalities in QoL and often focus on small numbers of cities or countries. We applied theory and methods from landscape ecology to explore associations between cities' land cover/use, residents' reported life satisfaction and within-city socio-economic inequalities in life satisfaction. We joined individual level responses to the European Urban Audit (EUA) Perception Surveys (2012, 2015) with city-level data from the European Urban Atlas classifying land cover/use into 26 different classes. Our sample included 63,554 people from 66 cities in 28 countries. Multilevel binary logistic models found that specific land use measures were associated with life satisfaction, including the amount of a city which was: residential (OR:0.991, 95%CI 0.984-0.997); isolated structures (OR:1.046, 95 CI 1.002-1.091); roads (OR0.989, 95%CI 0.982-0.996); pastures (OR: 1.002, 95% CI 1.002-1.003) and herbaceous vegetation (OR:0.998, 95%CI 0.997-0.100). A more even distribution of land cover/use (beta: 1.561, 95%CI-3.021 to 0.102) was associated with lower inequality in life satisfaction. This is the first study to theorise and examine how the entire urban landscape may affect levels of and inequalities in wellbeing in a large international sample. Our finding that more equal distribution of land cover/use is associated with lower levels of socio-economic inequality in life satisfaction supports the idea that city environments could be equigenic that is, could create equality. Our findings can aid urban planners to develop and build cities that can contribute to improving, and narrowing inequalities in, residents' life satisfaction.",2019,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,226,,263-274,WOS:000466251700032,10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.009,,#3147,Olsen 2019,
Effects of Outdoor Walking on Positive and Negative Affect: Nature Contact Makes a Big Difference,"Legrand, FD; Jeandet, P; Beaumont, F; Polidori, G","It has been consistently demonstrated that physical exercise is a cost-effective way to promote emotional well-being. However, the environment in which it takes place might amplify or mitigate this beneficial effect. The present study aimed at comparing the effects of walking in a natural or urban field setting on positive and negative affect. For this purpose, 150 students (46 female, 104 male; mean age: 20.2 years) were randomized into one of three groups: Green Walking (GW, n = 50), Urban Walking (UW, n = 50), or no-exercise (control; CTRL, n = 50). Positive and negative affect ratings were collected for each participant before and after walking (or before and after attending a class in the CTRL group). Exercise parameters (duration, intensity, weather conditions, group size) were identical in the GW and UW groups. The walking routes differed in terms of vegetation density, proximity of water, presence of traffic, and amount of asphalted surfaces. Participants in the GW and UW groups reported significant reductions in negative affect pre- to post walking. However, positive affect was increased only for participants in the GW group. This finding may have meaningful implications for mental health professionals who treat patients with significant emotional distress or mood instability. Several explanations are discussed as potential mechanisms for the more beneficial effect of Green walking, and presented as an important avenue for future research.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,16,,,WOS:000812994900001,10.3389/fnbeh.2022.901491,,#3154,Legrand 2022,
"The Effects of an Urban Forest Health Intervention Program on Physical Activity, Substance Abuse, Psychosomatic Symptoms, and Life Satisfaction among Adolescents","Tesler, R; Plaut, P; Endvelt, R","Background: At-risk adolescents have been defined as youth who are or might be in physical, mental, or emotional danger. An Urban Forest Health Intervention Program (UFHIP) was formed at a center for at-risk adolescents in Israel, in order to promote physical activity and reduce risky behavior. Objective: To evaluate the intervention's effect on physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, psychosomatic symptoms, and life satisfaction. Methods: From 2015 to 2016, at-risk youth were nonrandomly selected to participate in the UFHIP. Questionnaires were administered to both intervention and control groups before and after the intervention. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated the intervention's effect. Results: The study participants (n = 53) showed 0.81 more sessions per week of 60 min of physical activity than did the control group (n = 23; p = 0.003). Among the intervention group, smoking frequency reduced from a mean of 2.60 (SD = 1.30) to 1.72 (SD = 1.08), whereas that in the control group increased from 3.17 (1.03) to 3.39 (1.03). In both groups, there was a reduction in alcohol consumption, with a greater change among intervention participants: -1.08 (SD = 1.30), compared with -0.09 (SD = 1.79) in the control group. Conclusions: Findings indicate that the environmental intervention was efficacious in increasing physical activity and reducing risky behaviors among youth. The effectiveness of this intervention among larger samples is warranted in future prospective studies.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,15,10,,WOS:000448818100076,10.3390/ijerph15102134,,#3173,Tesler 2018,
Effects of garden visits on people with dementia: A pilot study,"Liao, ML; Ou, SJ; Hsieh, CH; Li, ZL; Ko, CC","The number of people with dementia is increasing rapidly worldwide. Developing strategies to improve quality of life for those with dementia is crucial and is receiving more attention. Natural environments are known for their healing effects on most people. This pilot study aimed to understand the benefits that natural environments, such as gardens, can provide for people with dementia. In total, 42 staff members in nine dementia care facilities were recruited as participants in this study and answered a semistructured questionnaire. One-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the effects of garden visits on evaluated characteristics and the differences in evaluated characteristics between free garden use and unfree garden use groups. Data from open-ended questions underwent text analysis to obtain the principal beliefs of the participants. The staff members reported that garden visits had positive effects on mood, social interaction, depression, and agitation in people with dementia because of the multisensory, gentle stimuli of the natural environment. Of the evaluated cognitive characteristics, attention and orientation to time were improved the most after residents with dementia had spent time in a garden. Additionally, staff members in the free garden use group scored the effects of garden visits on the mood, long-term memory, language abilities, spatial ability, aggression, and agitation of patients with dementia as significantly higher than staff members in the unfree garden use group. Recommendations for future studies are discussed.",2020,,DEMENTIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,19,4,1009-1028,WOS:000527985400006,10.1177/1471301218793319,,#3189,Liao 2020,
Young adult conservation jobs and worker health,"Wolf, KL; Housley, E","Decades of research studies demonstrate links between healthy environment, healthy lifestyles, and healthy people. This study evaluated the correlations between young adult conservation workers' perceived stress, personal effectiveness, and nature experience using quantitative and qualitative social science methods. The study cohort numbered nearly 300 individuals serving on small crews for an entire year, and were dispersed across Washington State (USA) to participate in conservation projects in rural to urban landscapes. Pre- and post-test surveys, using validated measures of perceived stress, health dimensions, and personal resiliency, were further informed by mid-year, field-based interviews. Overall, the young adults expressed fatigue with the physical work but were quite healthy when compared to national benchmarks. They indicated a reduction in perceived stress, and indicated social function influences based on the conservation work. Conclusions address the importance and implications of expanding this work opportunity to a more diverse cohort and future research needs.",2017,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,60,10,1853-1870,WOS:000405409100008,10.1080/09640568.2016.1262833,,#3201,Wolf 2017,
Influence of Informal Education in the Forest Stand Redevelopment Area on the Psychological Restoration of Working Adults,"Korcz, N; Janeczko, E; Bielinis, E; Urban, D; Koba, J; Szabat, P; Malecki, M","Background and Objectives: Nowadays, a significant part of the human population lives and works in urban agglomerations. Limited contact with nature, polluted air, stress, and a sedentary work style all contribute to problems with the physical and mental health of a considerable number of city dwellers. There are many studies indicating the positive, restorative properties of natural environments, such as forests, on human well-being. Our aim was to investigate whether suburban commercial forests in combination with informal environmental education can bring restorative properties to people, especially those who are economically active. Materials and Methods: Four psychological questionnaires were used to determine the restorative properties of a suburban commercial forest on young active people: the Profile of Mood Scale (POMS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), and the Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS). The experiment involved 60 participants who took forest baths (the act of spending time in a forest and opening your senses to the natural surroundings to experience feelings of peace and wellbeing) in a suburban commercial forest surrounding Swidnik, a city of 40,000 inhabitants located directly next to Lublin (a provincial city with a population of 339,811). The volunteers were divided into three groups; Group A walked an educational route with educational boards (route A1). Group B walked another route with a forest educator who described various forest management activities conducted in this forest (route A2). Group C walked alone, without an educator, along route A2. All three groups arrived at the site of forest stand redevelopment as the end of their route. After a short 10-min exposure to this site, the volunteers again completed the psychological questionnaires. Results: Our study clearly indicates a positive effect from forest bathing in suburban commercial forests. Both the walk with a forest educator and the walk along the educational trail supported psychological recovery for the participants of the experiment, which shows that informal environmental education carried out in forests can be successfully combined with forest bathing, supporting the positive effects of this activity.",2021,,FORESTS,12,8,,WOS:000689197600001,10.3390/f12080993,,#3220,Korcz 2021,
"How transport modes, the built and natural environments, and activities influence mood: A GPS smartphone app study","Glasgow, TE; Le, HTK; Geller, ES; Fan, YL; Hankey, S","Transportation-related mood studies relying on retrospective surveys incur recall bias, given the transient state of mood. Additionally, previous research in this domain has been limited to a single time-point measurement of mood, making it impossible to evaluate within-person variation. This study applied experience sampling methodology (ESM) to explore how mood during travel relates to transport mode, activities, and the built and natural environments. A smartphone application was employed to overcome the limitations of prior studies in this domain. Participants tracked their trips for at least one week and completed mood surveys after each trip. After accounting for within-person variation, active travel correlated with more positive mood than motorized travel, and mood was more positive when individuals talked to others during their trips. However, mood was more negative when completing errand trips as compared to other types of trips. Mood was lower when individuals traveled through places with a higher Walk Score, but higher when individuals traveled through natural environments. All participants felt less safe when bicycling. This field study was one of the first to consider within-person differences in mood during travel as a function of various environmental and transportation characteristics. The research demonstrated how information on mood could be used to promote sustainable transportation (e.g., walking, bicycling), as well as how urban transportation infrastructure could be designed to enhance mental well-being.",2019,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,66,,,WOS:000503091000009,10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.101345,,#3240,Glasgow 2019,
Greenery exposure and suicide mortality later in life: A longitudinal register-based case-control study,"Helbich, M; O'Connor, RC; Nieuwenhuijsen, M; Hagedoorn, P","Background: Exposure to residential greenery accumulates over people's lifetimes, and possibly has a protective association with suicide later in life.Objectives: To examine the associations between suicide mortality and long-term residential greenery exposure in male and female adults.Methods: Our population-based nested case-control study used longitudinally georeferenced Dutch register data. Suicide cases aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were matched by gender, age, and date of suicide to 10 random controls. We measured long-term greenery exposure along people's 10-year residential address histories through longitudinal normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from Landsat satellite imagery between 1997 and 2016. We assigned accumulated greenery exposures, weighted by people's exposure duration, within 300, 600, and 1,000 m concentric buffers around home addresses. To assess associations between suicide and greenery, we estimated gender-specific conditional logistic regressions without and with adjustment for individual-level and area-level confounders. Stratified models were fitted for areas with a high/low level of urbanicity and movers/non-movers.Results: Our study population consisted of 9,757 suicide cases and 95,641 controls. In our models adjusted for age, gender, and date of suicide, the odds ratios decreased significantly with higher quartiles of accumulated NDVI scores. NDVI associations were attenuated and did not remain significant after adjustment for socioeconomics, urbanicity, air pollution, social fragmentation, etc. for either males or females. For females, but not males, our model with 300 m buffers for areas with a low level of urbanicity showed a significant suicide risk reduction with increasing levels of NDVI. Individual risk factors (e.g., lack of labor market participation) outweighed the contribution of greenery.Conclusion: We found limited evidence that long-term greenery exposure over people's lifetimes contributes to resilience against suicide mortality. Ensuring exposure to greenery may contribute to suicide prevention for specific population groups, but the effectiveness of such exposure should not be overstated.",2020,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,143,,,WOS:000612205000009,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105982,,#3257,Helbich 2020,
Does nature make us happier? A spatial error model of greenspace types and mental wellbeing,"Houlden, V; de Albuquerque, JP; Weich, S; Jarvis, S","Exposure to nature is thought to benefit mental health and wellbeing. However, many studies consider greenspace as a single entity, which overlooks the potential significance of the various forms of greenspace, and natural greenspaces in particular. This study was designed to investigate the association between different types of greenspace and mental wellbeing. Drawing wellbeing and socioeconomic data from the Annual Population Survey (2012-2015), and shapefiles from the Greenspace Information for Greater London group, the amount of greenspace accessible within a 300 m walk of individual's postcodes was calculated, and categorised according to type. Spatial Error Models were used to account for spatial patterns in the data. Natural greenspace was significantly associated with improved life satisfaction (B = 0.028, p < 0.001) and happiness (B = 0.023, p = 0.019) scores. The spatial autoregressive parameter (lambda) was small but significant (p < 0.001), implying slight second-order spatial variation in the model. These results imply that natural areas may be more important for hedonic mental wellbeing than other greenspaces. Future research is needed on exploring causal relationships between exposure to greenspace and mental wellbeing outcomes.",2021,,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,48,4,655-670,WOS:000496624500001,10.1177/2399808319887395,,#3258,Houlden 2021,

This paper posits that the alleviation of unsolved life problems by means of unique personal (imaginativeness) and environmental (nature exposure) factors and their synthesis, so as to free up opportunities for other evolutionarily-essential tasks in humans, is posited to be pivotal - the unsolved problems hypothesis. Six hundred participants completed a study testing these assumptions on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results highlight the relevance of unsolved existential issues in relation to environmental (but not personal or integrative) influences on the majority of well-being indicators (e.g., extent of psychotic symptoms, annual income and procreative outcomes).

Neighbourhood greenspace and children's trajectories of self-regulation: Findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study,"Mueller, MAE; Flouri, E","Self-regulation in childhood is associated with multiple short- and long-term outcomes, including academic achievement, and physical and mental health. The literature to date suggests several individual and family factors that can influence children's development of self-regulation. However, the role of the wider context, particularly the wider physical context, remains less clear. In the present study, we investigated the association of neighbourhood greenspace quantity-a key physical environment factor-with children's self-regulation, using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). We modelled the trajectories of independence and emotional dysregulation of 13,774 children across the ages of three, five, and seven years, using growth curve modelling. Models accounted for neighbourhood air pollution and deprivation, urbanicity, home physical environment, family background, maternal education and depression, and child-level covariates. After full adjustment, some aspects of the home physical environment were associated with children's self-regulation: damp and condensation and secondhand smoke were associated with higher levels of emotional dysregulation. We did not find an association of neighbourhood greenspace quantity with either aspect of self-regulation in children. On the whole, child- and family-level covariates best explained children's differences in independence and emotional dysregulation.",2020,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,71,,,WOS:000581142200020,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101472,,#3292,Mueller 2020,
"Urban parks as a potential mitigator of suicide rates resulting from global pandemics: Empirical evidence from past experiences in Seoul, Korea","Kim, UR; Sung, H","Globally, the increased suicide rate of the general population has become a concern not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of its associated socioeconomic insecurity, loss of jobs, and economic shocks. This study employed robust fixed-effects panel models to empirically identify the mitigating effects of infectious diseases, via urban parks, on the suicide rate, and to examine gender differences in this regard, based on previous experiences in Seoul, Korea. We found that the differentiating mitigating effect did not significantly affect suicide rates during the 2015 MERS epidemic. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, wherein the number of confirmed cases was very high and diffused nationwide, urban parks significantly reduced the suicide rates for both men and women. The role of parks as a mitigator was more enhanced in cities with a high number of confirmed cases if it was associated with economic shocks. However, this effect was significant only in the suicide rates of men, not women. During a pandemic, urban parks can help maintain social interaction and sustain physical activities (i.e., walking and exercise) while maintaining physical distance. National and local governments should develop urban parks to actively control the suicide rate influenced by movement restriction measures inevitably occurring during the spread of infectious diseases.",2022,,CITIES,127,,,WOS:000811887300003,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103725,,#3304,Kim 2022,
"Neighbourhood greenness and mental wellbeing in Guangzhou, China: What are the pathways?","Liu, Y; Wang, RY; Grekousis, G; Liu, YQ; Yuan, Y; Li, ZG","Rapid urbanization in China has diminished urban residents' opportunities to connect with nature and thereby posed a great threat to their mental wellbeing. While a plethora of studies have disentangled the positive relationship between neighbourhood greenness and mental wellbeing in developed countries, scant attention has been paid to pathways through which neighbourhood greenness affects mental wellbeing among Chinese urban residents. This study aims to systematically explore biopsychosocial pathways linking exposure to neighbourhood greenness to mental wellbeing using survey data collected from 35 neighbourhoods of Guangzhou, China. It uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the surrogate for residential exposure to greenness, thereby enabling the comparison between China and other countries, Results from Structural Equation Modelling show that exposure to neighbourhood greenness is positively associated with mental wellbeing. Results also suggest that, consistent with what is known, promotion of walking, facilitation of social cohesion and satisfaction with neighbourhood greenspace play separate roles in mediating the protective effect of neighbourhood greenness. However, in contrast to previous findings from developed countries, this study finds no evidence to indicate that reduction in stress and mitigation of air/noise pollution are pathways linking exposure to greenness to mental wellbeing.

We assumed that walks through nature and urban environments affect self- and other-perceived stress and attractiveness levels. Therefore, we collected questionnaire data and took photographs of male participants' faces before and after they took walks. In a second step, female participants rated the photographs. As expected, participants felt more restored and attractive, and less stressed after they walked in nature compared to an urban environment. A significant interaction of environment (nature, urban) and time (pre, post) indicated that the men were rated by the women as being more stressed after the urban walk. Other-rated attractiveness levels, however, were similar for both walks and time points. In sum, we showed that the rather stressful experience of a short-term urban walk mirrors in the face of men and is detectable by women.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,17,22,,WOS:000594174800001,10.3390/ijerph17228519,,#3323,Menzel 2020,
Improving lifestyles sustainability through community gardening: results and lessons learnt from the JArDinS quasi-experimental study,"Tharrey, M; Sachs, A; Perignon, M; Simon, C; Mejean, C; Litt, J; Darmon, N","BackgroundDespite an increasing number of studies highlighting the health benefits of community gardening, the literature is limited by cross-sectional designs. The ""JArDinS"" quasi-experimental study aimed to assess the impact of community garden participation on the adoption of more sustainable lifestyles among French adults.MethodsIndividuals entering a community garden in Montpellier (France) in 2018 (n=66) were compared with pairwise matched individuals with no experience in community gardening (n=66). Nutritional quality, environmental impact and cost of monthly household food supplies, level of physical activity measured by accelerometers, as well as mental and social well-being, sensitivity to food waste, and connection with nature were evaluated at baseline (t0) and 12months later (t1) to explore sustainability of lifestyles in social/health, environmental and economic dimensions. Linear mixed models were used to determine the independent effect of community gardening on investigated lifestyles components. In-depth interviews were conducted at t1 with 15 gardeners to better understand changes that may have occurred in gardeners' lives during the first year of gardening.ResultsAt t0, gardeners had lower education level, lower BMI and their household reported lower percentage of meals consumed outside of the home compared to non-gardeners (p< 0.05). Participating in the community garden had no significant impact, in spite of sufficient statistical power, on fruit and vegetables supplies (main outcome), nor on physical activity parameters, nor on others of the social/health, environmental and economic lifestyles components investigated. Qualitative interviews suggested the existence of pre-established health and environmental consciousness in some gardeners and revealed several barriers to the participation such as lack of time, lack of gardening knowledge, physical difficulty of gardening, health problems and conflicts with other gardeners.ConclusionsThe health benefits of community gardening previously reported by cross-sectional studies might be confounded by selection bias. The JArDinS study highlights the need to identify solutions to overcome barriers related to community garden participation when designing relevant public health interventions for the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.Trial registrationThe study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03694782.

Cognitive Restoration in Children Following Exposure to Nature: Evidence From the Attention Network Task and Mobile Eye Tracking,"Stevenson, MP; Dewhurst, R; Schilhab, T; Bentsen, P","Exposure to nature improves cognitive performance through a process of cognitive restoration. However, few studies have explored the effect in children, and no studies have explored how eye movements ""in the wild"" with mobile eye tracking technology contribute to the restoration process. Our results demonstrated that just a 30-min walk in a natural environment was sufficient to produce a faster and more stable pattern of responding on the Attention Network Task, compared with an urban environment. Exposure to the natural environment did not improve executive (directed) attention performance. This pattern of results supports suggestions that children and adults experience unique cognitive benefits from nature. Further, we provide the first evidence of a link between cognitive restoration and the allocation of eye gaze. Participants wearing a mobile eye-tracker exhibited higher fixation rates while walking in the natural environment compared to the urban environment. The data go some way in uncovering the mechanisms sub-serving the restoration effect in children and elaborate how nature may counteract the effects of mental fatigue.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10,,,WOS:000457840200001,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00042,,#3334,Stevenson 2019,

This study investigated relationships between individual factors and both employees' use of workplace greenspace and the restoration outcomes they experienced from outdoor work breaks, through a questionnaire survey (N = 366) of employees at five urban-fringe science park business sites. A series of regression models suggested that job stress was positively related to levels of greenspace use and restoration benefits; however, the restoration reported by users varied depending on the social context of use. At the same time, key groups less engaged with the greenspace were identified. Finally, the analysis suggests that although some work-related factors may influence person-environment interactions in this context, individuals' relationship with greenspace appears to transcend the domains of work and home/leisure to a large degree.",2017,,ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR,49,3,314-338,WOS:000394783500004,10.1177/0013916516629194,,#3337,Colley 2017,
Does the outdoor environment matter for psychological restoration gained through running?,"Bodin, M; Hartig, T","Objectives: Outdoor environments might amplify or hinder psychological benefits of exercise. Using types of outdoor environment commonly available for exercise, we assessed the moderating effect of environment on attentional and emotional restoration during a run.Design: We conducted a field experiment with environment (park, urban), occasion (first run, second run), and time (pre-run, post-run) as within-subjects factors, and gender as a between-subjects factor.Methods: Twelve regular runners (6 female, 6 male; mean age = 39.7 years) provided self-reports of emotions and behavioral measures of attention before and after each of two 1-hour runs in each of the two environments. The routes differed in amount of greenery, proximity to water, and presence of traffic, buildings, and other people. We also obtained background measures of stress and evaluations of the running environments.Results: Characteristic of restoration, running reduced anxiety/depression and anger. It had inconsistent effects on attention. No Time x Environment interactions reached statistical significance. However, those for tranquility and anxiety/depression had medium-sized effects (rs approximate to 0.30) and were consistent with the hypothesis that the park would promote restoration while running to a greater degree than the urban environment. The runners preferred the park over the urban environment and perceived it as more psychologically restorative.Conclusions: The findings encourage replication with greater statistical power. The study provides a point of departure for further research on potential moderating effects of commonly accessible outdoor environments on the psychological benefits of exercise.

Let's go outside! Environmental restoration amongst adolescents and the impact of friends and phones,"Greenwood, A; Gatersleben, B","Adolescents are experiencing an increasing number of psychological difficulties due to mental fatigue and stress. Natural environments have been found to be beneficial to psychological wellbeing by reducing stress and improving mood and concentration for most people. However, a number of studies have suggested that this may not be the case for adolescents perhaps because they have different social and emotional needs (to be with friends, not to be bored), although evidence is lacking. In a field experiment with 120 16-18 year olds in the UK we tested restoration of stress and mental fatigue in an outdoor or indoor environment, alone, with a friend or while playing a game on a mobile phone. The findings showed greater restoration amongst adolescents who had been in an outdoor setting containing natural elements, compared with those who had been in an indoor one. Moreover, being with a friend considerably increased positive affect in nature for this age group. The findings indicated that spending short school breaks in a natural environment with a friend can have a significant positive impact on the psychological wellbeing of teenagers.

Poor quality of outdoor living environment (OLE) in these ORCs cannot well support the daily life of the elders, especially for those with physical problems. A questionnaire study was conducted to explore the influence of OLE on the QoL of elders living in ORCs. A total of 107 questionnaires were completed by both elderly residents in ORCs (45.79% were male and 54.21% were female). The data was analyzed by a mix of reliability analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The results showed that physical health of elders was influenced by distance, safety, greenery, seat, recreational facilities; psychological health was predicted by width, height, and greenery; social relationship was affected by distance, safety, and recreational facilities. Based on the research results, recommendations were proposed to property management service providers and local governments, including providing more seats at a reasonable height, setting handrails alongside the long ramp, installing folding seats along building stairs, and so on.",2019,,SUSTAINABILITY,11,23,,WOS:000508186400110,10.3390/su11236638,,#3364,Yu 2019,
Urban Adolescence: The Role of Neighbourhood Greenspace in Mental Well-Being,"Mueller, MAE; Flouri, E","Mental health and well-being in adolescence are associated with many short- and long-term outcomes. The evidence suggests that greenspace may play a role in adolescents' mental well-being, but we do not know much about the specifics of this link. In this paper, we investigated the role of other factors in the association. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the role of neighbourhood greenspace in emotional and behavioural outcomes in 11-year-old urban adolescents participating in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 4,534). We used linear regression models to test for an association of greenspace with self-esteem, happiness, positive mood, negative mood, and antisocial behaviour. We also investigated effect modification/moderation by garden access, physical activity, and perceived area safety. We did not find a main effect of greenspace, but we did find interaction effects. First, in adolescents without a garden, higher levels of greenspace were associated with lower levels of self-esteem and positive mood. Second, in adolescents who reported lower levels of physical activity, higher levels of greenspace were associated with lower levels of negative mood. Third, in adolescents who perceived their areas to be unsafe, higher levels of greenspace were associated with higher levels of antisocial behaviour. Our findings suggest that merely more greenspace in the neighbourhood may not be sufficient to promote the mental well-being of urban adolescents in the UK. However, greenspace does seem to have an influence under certain conditions which should be investigated further in future studies.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,12,,,WOS:000701372100001,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712065,,#3388,Mueller 2021,
Association Between Greenness Surrounding Schools and Kindergartens and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children in China,"Yang, BY; Zeng, XW; Markevych, I; Bloom, MS; Heinrich, J; Knibbs, LD; Dharmage, SC; Lin, S; Jalava, P; Guo, YM; Jalaludin, B; Morawska, L; Zhou, Y; Hu, LW; Yu, HY; Yu, YJ; Dong, GH","IMPORTANCE Few studies have investigated the association between greenness and childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between greenness surrounding schools or kindergartens and symptoms of ADHD in children.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cross-sectional study was performed between April 2012 and January 2013 in 7 cities in northeastern China. This analysis included 59 754 children (aged 2-17 years) from 94 schools and kindergartens, who had resided in the study area for 2 years or longer. Data were analyzed from April 15, 2019, to October 10, 2019.EXPOSURES Greenness surrounding each child's school or kindergarten was estimated using 2 satellite image-derived vegetation indexes: the normalized difference vegetation index and the soil-adjusted vegetation index.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) scales were used to measure ADHD symptoms (9 inattention symptoms and 9 hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms). Parents or guardians rated the frequency of each of 18 ADHD symptoms during the preceding 6 months. Children with 6 or more symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity were defined as having ADHD symptoms. Generalized linear mixed models were applied to estimate the association between greenness and ADHD symptoms.RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 59 754 study participants was 10.3 (3.6) years, and 29 494 (49.4%) were girls. A total of 2566 participants (4.3%) had ADHD symptoms. Greenness levels differed substantially across schools and kindergartens. The normalized difference vegetation index within 500 m of a school or kindergarten ranged from -0.09 to 0.77. Greater greenness levels were associated with lower odds of ADHD symptoms. In covariate-adjusted models, a 0.1-unit increase in normalized difference vegetation index or soil-adjusted vegetation index within 500mof a school or kindergarten was significantly associated with lower odds of ADHD symptoms (odds ratios, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.83-0.91] and 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.86], respectively; P < .001 for both). The associations were robust in a series of sensitivity analyses.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that there may be a beneficial association between school-based greenness and ADHD symptoms in Chinese children. Future longitudinal and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm the findings of this cross-sectional analysis and further explore potential mechanisms of this association.",2019,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,2,12,,WOS:000512329100094,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.17862,,#3395,Yang 2019,
A Repeated Measures Experiment of Green Exercise to Improve Self-Esteem in UK School Children,"Reed, K; Wood, C; Barton, J; Pretty, JN; Cohen, D; Sandercock, GRH","Exercising in natural, green environments creates greater improvements in adult's self-esteem than exercise undertaken in urban or indoor settings. No comparable data are available for children. The aim of this study was to determine whether so called 'green exercise' affected changes in self-esteem; enjoyment and perceived exertion in children differently to urban exercise. We assessed cardiorespiratory fitness (20 m shuttle-run) and self-reported physical activity (PAQ-A) in 11 and 12 year olds (n = 75). Each pupil completed two 1.5 mile timed runs, one in an urban and another in a rural environment. Trials were completed one week apart during scheduled physical education lessons allocated using a repeated measures design. Self-esteem was measured before and after each trial, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and enjoyment were assessed after completing each trial. We found a significant main effect (F (1,74), = 12.2, p<0.001), for the increase in self-esteem following exercise but there was no condition by exercise interaction (F (1,74), = 0.13, p = 0.72). There were no significant differences in perceived exertion or enjoyment between conditions. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.26, p = 0.04) between habitual physical activity and RPE during the control condition, which was not evident in the green exercise condition (r = -0.07, p = 0.55). Contrary to previous studies in adults, green exercise did not produce significantly greater increases in self-esteem than the urban exercise condition. Green exercise was enjoyed more equally by children with differing levels of habitual physical activity and has the potential to engage less active children in exercise.",2013,,PLOS ONE,8,7,,WOS:000322167900043,10.1371/journal.pone.0069176,,#3399,Reed 2013,
Home gardens moderate the relationship between Covid-19-induced stay-at-home orders and mental distress: a case study with urban residents of India,"Basu, M; DasGupta, R; Kumar, P; Dhyani, S","With the increasing spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictions on public life were strengthened across the world. Non-pharmaceutical interventions like stay-at-home orders, cancellations of events, work from home, etc. are the first line of defence to combat the spread of highly transmittable infections like Covid-19. But these interventions create whole new situations that urban residents need to cope with, which often creates mental distress. Home gardens, due to their therapeutic benefits, can help individuals to relax and unwind, thus reduce mental distress. Hence, the present study attempts to investigate whether home gardens moderate the effects on mental distress from confinement at homes due to the enforcement of stay-at-home orders. Samples (N = 408) were collected through an online question survey with urban residents across different parts of India. Moderation analysis reported the significant effect of home gardens in lowering mental distress. Further analysis with time spent in home gardens revealed that with increasing time spent from less than 10 min to more than 2 h, an individual score of stress and anxiety, and overall Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)-21 scores had significantly decreased. These findings illustrate the beneficial properties of nature-based solutions, home gardens in this case, in improving mental health, even during the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results suggest the necessity of scaling up these nature-based solutions in urban planning processes to make the residents healthy and resilient.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,3,10,,WOS:000705912600001,10.1088/2515-7620/ac2ab2,,#3414,Basu 2021,
Effects of a sensory garden on workplace wellbeing: A randomised control trial,"Souter-Brown, G; Hinckson, E; Duncan, S","Chronic stress impacts workplace wellbeing. To counter this, stress recovery and attention restoration theories assert a need for nature connection. However, the impacts of environmental design typologies are poorly understood. This research sought to explore the potential of salutogenic design as a stress-reducing health promotion tool for 'apparently well' people in a workplace setting.A randomised controlled trial compared 'apparently well' (n = 164), 18-65-year-old staff and students at a University campus in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited and randomised into two intervention groups, sensory garden (SG; n = 57), and urban plaza (UP; n = 51), and a control group (CG; n = 56). SG and UP participants had a monitored 'appointment outdoors' for 30 min once weekly for four weeks. All participants were tested for salivary cortisol, perceived wellbeing, productivity, perceived stress, nature relatedness preand post-intervention; data were analysed using generalised linear models.Significant intervention effects (SG vs control) were observed for salivary cortisol (-16.1% [95% CI: -32.0%, 0.2%]; p = 0.048), wellbeing (6.9% [95% CI: 2.7%, 11.1%]; p = 0.001) and productivity (2.8% [95% CI: 0.1%, 5.5%]; p = 0.040). Although not significant, a surprising trend towards negative effects of the Plaza on wellbeing (-4%[95% CI:-8.78%, 0.35%]; p = 0.071), productivity (-2% [95% CI:-5.38%, 1.34%]; p = 0.238), and perceived stress (19% [95% CI:-59.87, 21.49]; p = 0.355) were observed when compared to the SG group.This study suggests a sensory garden effectively reduces stress, enhances wellbeing and improves productivity of 'apparently well' people in the workplace.

Nurtured in Nature: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial to Increase Time in Greenspace among Urban-Dwelling Pregnant Women,"South, EC; Lee, K; Oyekanmi, K; Buckler, DG; Tiako, MJN; Martin, T; Kornfield, SL; Srinivas, S","Spending time in nature is associated with numerous mental health benefits, including reduced depression and improved well-being. However, few studies examine the most effective ways to nudge people to spend more time outside. Furthermore, the impact of spending time in nature has not been previously studied as a postpartum depression (PPD) prevention strategy. To fill these gaps, we developed and pilot tested Nurtured in Nature, a 4-week intervention leveraging a behavioral economics framework, and included a Nature Coach, digital nudges, and personalized goal feedback. We conducted a randomized controlled trial among postpartum women (n = 36) in Philadelphia, PA between 9/9/2019 and 3/27/2020. Nature visit frequency and duration was determined using GPS data. PPD was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Participants were from low-income, majority Black neighborhoods. Compared to control, the intervention arm had a strong trend toward longer duration and higher frequency of nature visits (IRR 2.6, 95%CI 0.96-2.75, p = 0.059).

We aimed to clarify the relationship between depression in older adults and three types of neighborhood greenspaces: trees, grasslands, and fields. We utilized data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) performed in 2016. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used for non-stratified and stratified analyses for the urban-rural regions. The target population comprised 126,878 older adults (age >= 65 years) who responded to the depression questions and were living in 881 neighborhoods in Japan. Depression was diagnosed based on a Geriatric Depression Scale score >= 5, and 20.4% of the study population had depression. In the pre-stratification analysis, areas with more greenspaces revealed lower odds of depression (odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-0.95). In urban areas, more trees correlated with lower odds of depression (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-1.00). In rural areas, moderate amounts of grassland were associated with lower odds of depression compared to areas with fewer grasslands (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00).

The aim of this research is to gain further knowledge of the restorativeness of a best case urban and natural environment: that is a historic down town urban environment and forest environment located in an arboretum. The study has a cross-over design where 51 (N) female university students are exposed to the two environments through both seated viewing and walking. A mixed method approach is used with both physiological measurements of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV) and psychological measurements of mood change and perceived restorativeness. The HRV results show no significant differences between the two environments, and both environments are found to be more physiologically restorative than being at the office or on the minibus. The results of the psychological measures indicate that the forest walk has a positive effect on mood, while the walk in the urban environment has no effect. The forest environment is also rated more highly with regard to perceived restorativeness than the urban environment. The results support the current research that shows natural environments as more restorative than urban environments.

Psychological Benefits of Walking: Moderation by Company and Outdoor Environment,"Johansson, M; Hartig, T; Staats, H","Background: We aimed to assess moderation of affective and cognitive effects of a brisk walk by urban environmental characteristics and the immediate social context. Methods: We conducted a field experiment with time (pre-walk, post-walk), type of environment (park, street), and social context (alone, with a friend) as within-subjects factors. Twenty university students reported on affective states and completed a symbol-substitution test before and after each of two 40-minute walks in each environment. The routes differed in amount of greenery, proximity to water, and presence of traffic, buildings, and other people. Results: On average, walking per se increased positive affect and reduced negative affect. Feelings of time pressure declined to a greater extent with the park walk than the street walk. Revitalisation increased during the park walks to a greater degree when alone, but it increased more during the walk along streets when with a friend. We found an inconclusive pattern of results for performance on the symbol-substitution test.

Assessing the restorative potential of contemporary urban environment(s): Beyond the nature versus urban dichotomy,"Karmanov, D; Hamel, R","The current literature on restorative environments generally leads to the conclusion that urban environments are inherently deficient in stress-reducing and mood-enhancing capacities.

We provide empirical evidence, making use of an abbreviated version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, that a well-designed and attractive urban environment can have a stress-reducing and mood-enhancing power equal to that of an attractive natural environment. We attempt to identify the physical characteristics that contribute to the perceived restorative effect of the urban environment we selected for our study.Another issue we explored was the impact of a narrative on the attractiveness and interestingness of the natural and urban environments. We wrote a story to go with each of our environments, describing some of the meanings embedded in their physical properties. The addition of cultural and historical information about our natural and urban environments resulted into a 25% increase in their perceived interestingness and a 14% increase in their perceived attractiveness.

Attention restoration theory (ART) provides an analysis of the kinds of environments that lead to improvements in directed-attention abilities. Nature, which is filled with intriguing stimuli, modestly grabs attention in a bottom-up fashion, allowing top-down directed-attention abilities a chance to replenish. Unlike natural environments, urban environments are filled with stimulation that captures attention dramatically and additionally requires directed attention (e.g., to avoid being hit by a car), making them less restorative. We present two experiments that show that walking in nature or viewing pictures of nature can improve directed-attention abilities as measured with a backwards digit-span task and the Attention Network Task, thus validating attention restoration theory.",2008,,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,19,12,1207-1212,WOS:000261718100002,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02225.x,,#3541,Berman 2008,

Eighty students from an urban Canadian elementary school were recruited to participate in field trips to a nature school and an aviation/space museum. Children reported more positive and negative emotions, a closer connection to nature, and a greater willingness to protect nature when at the nature school.

The Association between Exposure to Nature and Children's Happiness: The Diathesis-Stress or Differential Susceptibility Models?,"Cui, W; Yang, ZH","Research has demonstrated that both family environments and individual characteristics are associated with children's happiness. However, relatively less research has explored whether and how natural environments are associated with children's happiness. The current study examines whether the association between exposure to nature and children's happiness is moderated by temperament (negative affectivity and effortful control), whether there is a gender difference in the moderating mechanisms, and whether the detected moderation supports the diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility models. Four hundred and ten children and one parent of each child participated in our study. We found that boys' effortful control, not negative affectivity, moderated the association between exposure to nature and happiness. Furthermore, the results support the differential susceptibility model with boys' low effortful control as a vulnerability factor. Specifically, for boys with lower effortful control, a lower exposure to nature was associated with lower happiness, and a higher exposure to nature was associated with higher happiness than in boys with higher effortful control. However, girls' negative affectivity and effortful control did not moderate the association between exposure to nature and happiness. These findings suggest that the association between natural environments and children's positive developmental outcomes varies with their effortful control and gender.",2021,,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,155,8,755-768,WOS:000698743500001,10.1080/00223980.2021.1972919,,#3556,Cui 2021,

This holistic approach helped to contrast the healthy lifestyle of gardening with health risks from exposures to potentially toxic elements such as Cd and Pb in urban environments. A total of 120 participants who grew their own produce in an urban setting were recruited to the study. A detailed questionnaire was developed that included sections on gardening activity, cultivation and consumption of produce, consumption of commercially grown produce, and other lifestyle factors. Administered alongside the questionnaire was the Short Form 36 (v2) as a standardised tool for measuring physical and mental health. Fruit and vegetable consumption was found to be correlated with the amount of gardening individuals did in autumn/winter and was greater than fruit and vegetable consumption, on average, in the UK general population. Levels of physical activity were also found to be higher in our study than regional averages, whilst BMI was lower than average. This is the first study to find a relationship between gardening more regularly (in autumn/winter) and the physical component of the Short Form 36, and this relationship was elevated compared to non-gardening populations. The physical component scores from this study were also significantly higher for older participants, compared to means from a Western population. This finding supports studies suggesting that gardening may be more beneficial for the elderly generation. These benefits were assessed in the context of potential exposures estimated from the type and frequency of produce being consumed. The benefit of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is likely to outweigh the health risks of gardening on soils mildly contaminated with Cd and Pb but requires formal consideration within a risk management framework.",2022,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,12,1,,WOS:000747277600001,10.3390/agronomy12010181,,#3572,Stubberfield 2022,

"Crime, greenspace and life satisfaction: An evaluation of the New Zealand experience","Fleming, CM; Manning, M; Ambrey, CL","In this study we explore the relationship between the benefits of greenspace and fear of crime in New Zealand neighbourhoods. To ensure that the full benefits of investment in greenspace are realised, it is important to understand the complex interactions that occur within natural environments and the effect of these interactions on individual wellbeing within different populations (in this case New Zealand). Employing an ordered logit model, this study uses data on self-reported life satisfaction, fear of crime and access to greenspace from the New Zealand General Social Survey. In line with existing evidence, results suggest that greater access to greenspace is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction. The strength of this association, however, is strongly dependent on fear of crime. That is, when residents report that they feel 'unsafe' or 'very unsafe' in their neighbourhood, the psychological benefits of access to greenspace disappear almost entirely. This relationship is conditioned further by age and gender, with residents between 50 and 59 years of age and males being less likely to report being very satisfied with their lives. Given the considerable level of public investment in providing and maintaining greenspace, there is a clear need to address fear of crime in the neighbourhood in order to ensure that the full benefits of policies directed at promoting the use of neighbourhood greenspace for health and well-being can be realised.

The Restorative Effect of Staying in a Broad-Leaved Forest on Healthy Young Adults in Winter and Spring,"Bielinis, E; Omelan, A; Boiko, S; Bielinis, L","Many studies have assessed the impact of broad-leaved trees in the vegetative season on humans' restoration. But it still remains unknown if this positive effect will also be observable in broad-leaved forest during winter, when trees maintain no leaves. To test the hypothesis that broad-leaved trees also produce psychological restoration during winter (in comparison to spring), we designed an experiment, in which the same participants viewed the forest environment during these two seasons, while urban setting was used as a control environment. The participants filled in four psychological questionnaires, which measured different psychological conditions. The results confirmed the hypothesis that broad-leaved trees had the restorative effect in winter, and it was even greater than in spring time. These results suggest that the living woody plants in their natural environment produce a positive, psychological effect on humans, hence visiting broad-leaved forest also during winter can be recommended as a method for stress reduction.",2018,,BALTIC FORESTRY,24,2,218-227,WOS:000459518300007,,,#3643,Bielinis 2018,
Physiological and Psychological Effects of a Forest Therapy Program on Middle-Aged Females,"Ochiai, H; Ikei, H; Song, CR; Kobayashi, M; Miura, T; Kagawa, T; Li, Q; Kumeda, S; Imai, M; Miyazaki, Y","The natural environment is increasingly recognized as an effective counter to urban stress, and Forest Therapy has recently attracted attention as a relaxation and stress management activity with demonstrated clinical efficacy. The present study assessed the physiological and psychological effects of a forest therapy program on middle-aged females. Seventeen Japanese females (62.2 +/- 9.4 years; mean +/- standard deviation) participated in this experiment. Pulse rate, salivary cortisol level, and psychological indices were measured on the day before forest therapy and on the forest therapy day. Pulse rate and salivary cortisol were significantly lower than baseline following forest therapy, indicating that subjects were in a physiologically relaxed state. Subjects reported feeling significantly more comfortable, relaxed, and natural according to the semantic differential (SD) method. The Profile of Mood State (POMS) negative mood subscale score for tension-anxiety was significantly lower, while that for vigor was significantly higher following forest therapy. Our study revealed that forest therapy elicited a significant (1) decrease in pulse rate, (2) decrease in salivary cortisol levels, (3) increase in positive feelings, and (4) decrease in negative feelings.

A spatial analysis of proximate greenspace and mental wellbeing in London,"Houlden, V; de Albuquerque, JP; Weich, S; Jarvis, S","While local-area greenspace is associated with reduced symptoms of mental distress and greater life satisfaction, most previous research has measured the amount of local-area greenspace within administrative boundaries, and found mixed results for associations between greenspace and multidimensional mental wellbeing. The study was designed to examine whether the amount of greenspace within a radius of individuals' homes was associated with mental wellbeing, testing the government guideline that greenspace should be available within 300 m of homes.Individual and Household-level data were drawn from the Annual Population Survey at postcode level (APS, Pooled Dataset 2012-2015), which includes 3 mental wellbeing measures, covering aspects of life satisfaction, sense of worth, and happiness, as well as a range of socio-demographic variables. Greenspace data were obtained Greenspace Information for Greater London Group (GiGL), and was used to calculated the amount of greenspace within a 300 m radius of individuals. Linear regression models revealed positive and statistically significant associations between the amount of greenspace and indicators of life satisfaction and worth. Moran's I, an indicator of spatial autocorrelation, revealed statistically significant clustering of the residuals of these models, so Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were calculated, in order to adjust for underlying spatial processes within the data and investigate the geographic variation in the association between local greenspace and mental wellbeing. The global GWR model revealed that an increase in 1 ha of greenspace within 300 m of residents was associated with a statistically significant 0.803 increase in life satisfaction, 0.740 and 0.521 for worth and happiness, respectively. This therefore provides some support for the inclusion of greenspace within 300 m of homes. Local GWR coefficients revealed slight variation in the strength of these associations across the study space. Therefore, further analyses are required to investigate whether the walking (network distance), absolute size, or type of each greenspace are able to explain this spatial variation.",2019,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,109,,,WOS:000500199100005,10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102036,,#3659,Houlden 2019,
The influence of interaction with forest on cognitive function,"Shin, WS; Shin, CS; Yeoun, PS; Kim, JJ","The aim of this study was to investigate whether forest experience had a positive impact on cognitive function. Cognitive function refers to a person's ability to intellectually process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas. It involves all aspects of perception, thinking, reasoning, and remembering. Sixty university students participated in this study. We compared the restorative effects on cognitive functioning of interactions with forest versus urban environments. To measure participants' cognitive function and mood state, Trail Making Test B and Profile of Mood States were used in this study. The results of this study indicated that participants' cognitive function was significantly improved when they walked in forest (i.e. time taken to complete the task was shortened by more than 7 seconds), but not when they walked downtown. In addition, participants' mood also positively changed when they walked in forest. The results of this study confirmed Kaplan's attention restoration theory (ART).

A comparison of children with ADHD in a natural and built setting,"van den Berg, AE; van den Berg, CG","Background A link has been suggested between children's disconnection from nature and the recent surge in childhood disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Research on benefits of nature for healthy children provides some support for such a link. However, only a few studies have directly examined the influence of contact with nature on children with ADHD.Aim The aim of the present research was to gain more insight into the behaviour and emotional and cognitive functioning of children with ADHD in a natural and built setting.Methods Two groups of six children (age 9-17) who stayed at care farms for children with ADHD in the Netherlands were systematically observed, questioned, and tested during visits to a wooded area and a small town.Results Both groups performed better on a concentration task in the woods than in the town, despite the fact that all children visited the town after the woods and thus their scores in the town were possibly inflated by learning effects. However, the behaviour and emotional functioning in the two settings differed between the groups. One group of children liked the woods better than the town and displayed more positive behaviours and feelings in the natural environment. The other group of children liked the town equally well as the woods and displayed positive behaviours and feelings in both settings, although they showed somewhat more non-social, aggressive, inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behaviour in the town than in the woods.Conclusions These results suggest that natural areas provide a consistent positive environment for children with ADHD.

"Can Nature Walks With Psychological Tasks Improve Mood, Self-Reported Restoration, and Sustained Attention? Results From Two Experimental Field Studies","Pasanen, T; Johnson, K; Lee, K; Korpela, K","The evidence for restorative effects of contact with nature is vast. Drawing from two well-known theories in Environmental Psychology, Stress reduction theory and Attention restoration theory, restoration can be seen as a sequential, interactive process that begins with physiological relaxation and results in affective and attention restoration and broader life reflection. This interaction between a person and their environment may be facilitated by actively engaging with the environment but this has been understudied. We examined engagement with the environment by asking participants to complete psychological, restoration theory-driven tasks designed to enhance physiological, affective and attention restoration, while walking on nature trails. We conducted two experimental field studies (conceptual replications) in Finland in a coniferous forest (Study 1; n = 128) and an urban park (Study 2; n = 121). The participants walked at their own pace for 4 6 km with or without psychological tasks. Those in the task conditions completed either theory-based restoration-enhancement tasks or alternative tasks that we expected to be less restorative (Study 1: the same tasks in the reverse order; Study 2: awareness-enhancement tasks). The participants completed self-reports on valence, activation, and restoration, and the Sustained Attention to Response Task, before, and after, the walk. We compared the change between measurements using regression models grouped by study conditions, with age, recent stress, difficulties with wayfinding, start time, and navigation method (Study 2 only) as covariates. Valence and self-reported restoration improved after the walk, but there was no additional benefit from the psychological tasks. In both studies, sustained attention consistently improved following different versions of the restoration-enhancement tasks and, to some extent, after a walk without the tasks. Participants who were more stressed experienced greater improvements in valence and self-reported restoration (Study 1) and sustained attention (Study 2). The results support both Stress reduction theory and Attention restoration theory, and imply that some forms of active engagement with the environment can aid sustained attention but not affective restoration. Future research efforts are needed to replicate these findings and to assess any potential long-term or multiplicative effects of engagement-based tasks, or other strategies that could enhance positive engagement with the environment.",2018,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,9,,,WOS:000448670500001,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02057,,#3742,Pasanen 2018,
"The Mediating Effect of Nature Restorativeness, Stress Level, and Nature Connectedness in the Association between Nature Exposure and Quality of Life","Baceviciene, M; Jankauskiene, R","This study aimed to test the mediating effects of nature restorativeness, stress, and nature connectedness in the association between nature exposure and quality of life (QoL). Urban and rural Lithuanian inhabitants (n = 924; 73.6% were women), mean age of 40.0 +/- 12.4 years (age range of 18-79) participated in the study. In total, 31% of the respondents lived in rural areas. Study participants completed an online survey form with measures on sociodemographic factors, nature proximity, nature exposure, nature connectedness, and nature restorativeness, stress, and QoL assessed by the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire's (WHOQOL-BREF). Path analysis was conducted to test the mediating effects of nature restorativeness, stress, and nature connectedness in the model of nature exposure and QoL. Nature exposure was directly associated with a greater QoL (beta = 0.14; B = 2.60; SE = 0.57; p < 0.001) and mediated the association between nature proximity and QoL. Nature restorativeness and lower stress levels were mediators between nature exposure and QoL. Nature connectedness was a mediator between nature exposure and QoL. A path model was invariant across genders and the urban and rural place of residence groups: patterns of loadings of the pathways were found to be similar. Nature restorativeness (beta = 0.10-0.12; p < 0.01) had a positive effect on the psychological, physical, social, and environmental domains of QoL. Connectedness to nature positively predicted psychological (beta = 0.079; p < 0.05) and environmental (beta = 0.082; p < 0.05) domains of QoL. Enhancing nature exposure and nature connectedness might help strengthen QoL in urban and rural inhabitants.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,4,,WOS:000769121200001,10.3390/ijerph19042098,,#3762,Baceviciene 2022,
Comparing happiness associated with household and community gardening: Implications for food action planning,"Ambrose, G; Das, K; Fan, YL; Ramaswami, A","Municipal food action planning promotes local food production based on presumed environmental, health, equity, and well-being benefits. However, little is known about the well-being benefits of household versus community-scale agricultural gardening. This exploratory study in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USA, presents a first direct comparison of happiness (net affect, average happiness, and average meaningfulness) associated with agricultural gardening at the two scales surveying 118 household and 55 community gardeners. Although both groups, in our sample, were statistically similar demographically and reported similar interactions with their gardens (frequency: 3.0-3.6events/wk; duration-of-event: 1.45-1.84hr; and total-time/week: 3.78-5.30hr/wk), different self-reported, happiness patterns emerged. For both groups, gardening's net affect ranks among the top five among 12 daily activities. Community gardeners' average net affect while gardening (3.25; scale-6 to 6) is significantly higher than biking (2.32) and walking (2.08), whereas household gardeners showed no difference across these two activities. Through matched regressions (by demographics), community gardeners report statistically higher net affect (& UDelta; = 0.664, p-value = 0.034) and peak meaningfulness (& UDelta; = 0.254, p-value = 0.001) while gardening. Community gardener's net affect while gardening correlates negatively with family-companionship (& UDelta; =-0.660, p-value = 0.038) and positively with neighbor-companionship (& UDelta; = 0.945, p-value = 0.009).

Residential neighborhood greenery and children's cognitive development,"Reuben, A; Arseneault, L; Belsky, DW; Caspi, A; Fisher, HL; Houts, RMM; Moffitt, TE; Odgers, C","Children who grow up in neighborhoods with more green vegetation show enhanced cognitive development in specific domains over short timespans. However, it is unknown if neighborhood greenery per se is uniquely predictive of children's overall cognitive development measured across many years. The E-Risk Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative 1994-5 birth-cohort of children in Britain (n = 1658 urban and suburban dwelling participants), was used to test whether residential neighborhood greenery uniquely predicts children's cognitive development across childhood and adolescence. Greenery exposure was assessed from ages 5 to 18 using the satellite imagery-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 1-mile buffers around the home. Fluid and crystalized intellectual performance was assessed in the home at ages 5, 12, and 18 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and executive function, working memory, and attention ability were assessed in the home at age 18 using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Children living in residences surrounded by more neighborhood greenery scored significantly higher, on average, on IQ measures at all ages. However, the association between greenery and cognitive measures did not hold after accounting for family or neighborhood socioeconomic status. After adjustment for study covariates, child greenery exposure was not a significant predictor of longitudinal increases in IQ across childhood and adolescence or of executive function, working memory, or attention ability at age 18. Children raised in greener neighborhoods exhibit better overall cognitive ability, but the association is likely accounted for by family and neighborhood socioeconomic factors.",2019,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,230,,271-279,WOS:000470342400029,10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.029,,#3820,Reuben 2019,
Effect of Apartment Community Garden Program on Sense of Community and Stress,"Lee, SM; Jang, HJ; Yun, HK; Jung, YB; Hong, IK","Apartment housing has become a dominant form of urban residence. High dwelling density in apartment complexes causes frequent conflicts and disputes. To counter this, it is necessary to promote a sense of community among residents with programs such as a customized horticultural program for the introduction of a community garden in an apartment complex. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a community garden program in an apartment complex in fostering residents' sense of community and reducing stress. Experiments were performed in three groups: a group participating in the program based on the sense of community theory (SCG; n = 11), a group participating with a focus on horticultural education (HEG; n = 11), and a non-participation group (NPG; n = 10). The experimental results revealed that the sense of community was significantly higher in the SCG than in the HEG and NPG. The results suggest that the SCG positively affected the sense of community, overall energy, ratio between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and stress resistance. Considering these results, community garden programs with appropriate interventions to promote a sense of community are more effective in improving community life and reducing stress than programs based on horticultural education.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,2,,WOS:000747727600001,10.3390/ijerph19020708,,#3825,Lee 2022,
"Evaluation of effect of tree canopy on thermal environment, thermal sensation, and mental state","Yoshida, A; Hisabayashi, T; Kashihara, K; Kinoshita, S; Hashida, S","Greenery is considered an important countermeasure technology that can be used to improve the thermal environment in urban areas. In this study, the effects of environmental factors relating to tree canopies on physiological response and human sensible temperatures were examined. Measurements were analyzed to determine the mutual relationship between the environmental elements of the tree canopy and the physiological response and psychological reaction. In five areas with tree canopies of different forms, located on the Osaka Prefecture University campus, measurements were performed during the hot summer season. The amount of solar radiation in the tree canopy was greatly attenuated in comparison to sunlit locations. In addition, it was determined that the air temperature in the tree canopy was about 1 degrees C lower in sunlit areas. Human thermal load under the tree canopies is closer to neutral than in sunlit places. The blocking of solar radiation greatly affected physiological response. Results of psychological testing confirm the effect of comfort was experienced under tree canopies. However, gloomy impressions were suffered in areas where the leaf area index was large. The fatigue value correlated best with physiological response. It was concluded that the thermal sensation of hot was causing mental fatigue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nature can get it out of your mind: The rumination reducing effects of contact with nature and the mediating role of awe and mood,"Lopes, S; Lima, M; Silva, K","Evidence has been found that contact with nature may reduce rumination in healthy individuals living in urban environments. This paper aims at i) testing whether one may replicate previous findings using a shorter duration of nature exposure, and ii) explore the possibility that a shift in attention away from self (notably induced by the emotion of awe), leading to mood restoration, may mediate such nature-rumination relationship.We showed that a walk as short as 30-min in an urban park significantly reduced ruminative thinking in healthy participants, whereas a 30-min walk along a city transect devoid from natural elements did not. Also, we showed that the ""walk in nature"" significantly reduced negative mood and elicited more awe and more externally oriented thoughts than the ""walk in city"". Our mediation analysis did not show any direct effect of contact with nature on rumination levels. Instead, it showed that the more awe participants experienced while walking, the more negative affect was reduced, which then lead to reduced rumination. Also, our mediation analysis showed that nature can affect rumination via mood improvement only and irrespective of awe.This study adds to previous research supporting the so-called ""psychological ecosystem services"" and calls for additional efforts aimed at exploring the extent to, and mechanism(s), by which contact with nature may affect rumination, notably in clinical populations.",2020,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,71,,,WOS:000581142200009,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101489,,#3877,Lopes 2020,

Participants walked on walking courses in an urban park and city street for 11-15 min. Their heart rate and blood pressure were evaluated to determine physiological responses. The Profile of Mood States (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Landscape Image Sketching Technique (LIST) were used to determine psychological responses and spatial conditions. Walking in an urban park exhibited lower heart rates and blood pressure as compared to walking in the city. It was congruent with lowered negative moods, total mood disturbance (TMD) scores, and state anxiety, while the higher positive mood was observed in the urban parks as compared to the city.

Perceived changes in well-being and happiness with gardening in urban organic allotments in Portugal,"Mourao, I; Moreira, MC; Almeida, TC; Brito, LM","Urban allotment gardens (AG) in Portugal have increased in recent years, as in many other European countries and worldwide. The contribution of these gardens to the happiness and well-being of urban populations has been recognized, but evaluations of their benefits are still very scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate this contribution, based on the urban organic AG of the Devesa Park in Vila Nova de FamalicAo, Portugal. The sample included 65 gardeners who completed the self-administered questionnairesof Bem-Estar Pessoal (personal well-being scale), Felicidade Subjetiva (subjective happiness scale) and sociodemographic characteristics. Respondents were mainly adults under 65years, married and academically well qualified and about half of them had a professional activity, with nearly one third being retired. They considered themselves happy with their life (Personal Well-being Index=74.5%) and revealed an optimistic and positive attitude towards life, regardless of economic or social difficulties. The increased frequency of visits for gardening was positively related to a greater perception of subjective happiness. The gardeners who visited the AG more frequently considered themselves happier from a self-perspective and in comparison with peers. It can be suggested that urban organic AG represent a means for enhancing citizen well-being, contributing positively to their feelings of happiness and life satisfaction, changing behaviours and developing personal capacities. Beyond economic measures, urban AG can be recommended to capture the well-being of societies.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,26,1,79-89,WOS:000453360100008,10.1080/13504509.2018.1469550,,#3881,Mourao 2019,

However, few field studies have measured well-being of urban gardening, particularly during household gardening. Our study develops protocols to measure emotional well-being (EWB) reported during household gardening, comparing it with other leisure and day-to-day activities. We also explore how gardening EWB varies across gardener type (vegetable vs ornamental), demographics, neighborhood type, and companionship during gardening. Using a recently developed app-based Day Reconstruction Method, EWB was measured across 370 participants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Area, USA, wherein 118 (32%) reported engaging in household gardening. Innovatively, five measures of EWB were computed for each participant for each activity type: average net affect, average happiness, average meaningfulness, the frequency of experiencing peak positive emotions (happiness and meaningfulness). Among all three average EWB measures, gardening is among the top 5 out of 15 activities assessed, and, is not statistically different from biking, walking and eating out. All four of these activities fall behind other leisure/recreation activities, which ranks first. For frequency of experiencing peak happiness, only other leisure/recreation activities were statistically higher than all the remaining (14) activities. Average net affect of gardening was significantly higher for vegetable gardeners (vs ornamental), for low-income gardeners (vs higher income) and for women.

The effects of walking in nature on negative and positive affect in adult psychiatric outpatients with major depressive disorder: A randomized-controlled study,"Watkins-Martin, K; Bolanis, D; Richard-Devantoy, S; Pennestri, MH; Malboeuf-Hurtubise, C; Philippe, F; Guindon, J; Gouin, JP; Ouellet-Morin, I; Geoffroy, MC","Background: While walking in nature has been shown to improve affect in adults from the community to a greater extent than walking in urban settings, it is unknown whether such benefits apply to individuals suffering from depression. Using a parallel group design, this randomized controlled trial examined the effects of a single walk in nature versus urban settings on negative and positive affect in adult psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Participants recruited from a psychiatric outpatient clinic for adults with MDD were randomly assigned to a nature or urban walk condition. Thirty-seven adults (mean age = 49 years) completed a single 60-minute walk. Negative and positive affect were assessed using The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule or PANAS at 6 time points: before the walk, halfway during the walk, immediately post-walk, at home before bedtime, 24 h post-walk, and 48 h post-walk. Results: Controlling for baseline levels of affect before the walk, individuals who walked in nature experienced overall lower levels of negative affect, F(1, 35.039) = 4.239, p =.047, compared to those who walked in urban settings. Positive affect did not differ across walk conditions. Limitations: The generalizability of results are limited by the small sample size and the presence of more female than male participants. Conclusions: Walking in nature might be a useful strategy to improve negative affect in adults with MDD. Future research should investigate different ways to integrate the beneficial effects of nature exposure into existing treatment plans for psychiatric outpatients with MDD.",2022,,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,318,,291-298,WOS:000888755200011,10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.121,,#3904,Watkins-Martin 2022,
Urban Nature Experiences Reduce Stress in the Context of Daily Life Based on Salivary Biomarkers,"Hunter, MR; Gillespie, BW; Chen, SYP","Stress reduction through contact with nature is well established, but far less is known about the contribution of contact parameters - duration, frequency, and nature quality. This study describes the relationship between duration of a nature experience (NE), and changes in two physiological biomarkers of stress - salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase. It is the first study to employ long-term, repeated-measure assessment and the first evaluation wherein study participants are free to choose the time of day, duration, and the place of a NE in response to personal preference and changing daily schedules. During an 8-week study period, 36 urban dwellers were asked to have a NE, defined as spending time in an outdoor place that brings a sense of contact with nature, at least three times a week for a duration of 10 min or more. Their goal was compliance within the context of unpredictable opportunity for taking a nature pill. Participants provided saliva samples before and after a NE at four points over the study period. Before-NE samples established the diurnal trajectory of each stress indicator and these were in line with published outcomes of more closely controlled experiments. For salivary cortisol, an NE produced a 21.3%/hour drop beyond that of the hormone's 11.7% diurnal drop. The efficiency of a nature pill per time expended was greatest between 20 and 30 min, after which benefits continued to accrue, but at a reduced rate. For salivary alpha-amylase, there was a 28.1%/h drop after adjusting for its diurnal rise of 3.5%/h, but only for participants that were least active sitting or sitting with some walking. Activity type did not influence cortisol response. The methods for this adaptive management study of nature-based restoration break new ground in addressing some complexities of measuring an effective nature dose in the context of normal daily life, while bypassing the limitations of a clinical pharmacology dose-response study. The results provide a validated starting point for healthcare practitioners prescribing a nature pill to those in their care. This line of inquiry is timely in light of expanding urbanization and rising healthcare costs.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10,,,WOS:000463388100001,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00722,,#3909,Hunter 2019,
Changes in cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone levels immediately after urban park visits,"Gao, J; Mancus, GC; Yuen, HK; Watson, JH; Lake, ML; Jenkins, GR","The purpose of this study is to explore physiological and psychological changes immediately after a short-term visit to urban parks in an uncontrolled condition. Sixty park visitors completed a short questionnaire evaluating their subjective well-being (SWB) and donated a saliva sample immediately before and after their park visit. In addition, participants wore a pedometer to track their physical activity level during the park visit. Results indicated the levels of all biomarkers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], and cortisol/DHEA ratio) decreased while SWB scores increased after the park visit. The duration of park visit was identified as a key variable significantly associated with cortisol reduction, and changes in SWB scores after the park visit were significantly associated with changes in cortisol level. A park visit duration of 21.8 min has the predictive ability to discriminate park visitors who exhibit reductions in cortisol levels after the park visit from those who do not.",,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH,,,,WOS:000728502600001,10.1080/09603123.2021.2013454,,#3910,,
See or Be? Contact with nature and well-being during COVID-19 lockdown,"Mintz, KK; Ayalon, O; Nathan, O; Eshet, T","This study investigated how contact with nature benefitted well-being during a strict lockdown. The study took place in Israel during the last week of the first COVID-19 lockdown, when citizens were restricted to remain within 100 m of home. A survey company distributed questionnaires among 776 individuals. The questionnaires included demographic variables (gender, ethnic and cultural groups, age, income loss due to the pandemic), contact with nature variables (Nature near home, Nature viewed from home windows, and being in nature on the preceding day), and well-being measures (positive affect, negative affect, vitality, happiness, and stress). Before completing the well-being questionnaire, participants took part in an experiment that tested the effect of viewing nature images or urban images on well-being measures. The results showed that nature near home and nature viewed from the windows contributed to higher levels of well-being, and that being in nature on the preceding day was associated with higher levels of positive affect. These benefits emerged even among those who had been economically harmed by the pandemic. Viewing nature images was also associated with level of well-being, mainly to reduced level of stress and negative affect. The current findings extend the understanding of the benefits of access to nature during stressful times, particularly during emergencies when accessing remote nature is impossible. Furthermore, the findings highlight the dual effect of contact with nature on well-being: enhancement of positive affect together with reduction of negative affect and stress. The findings indicate that exposure to nature is much more valuable for women than for men. These findings are highly important in view of gender differences in pandemic's impact on people's well-being.",2021,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,78,,,WOS:000718033400003,10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101714,,#3915,Mintz 2021,
"Empirical study of landscape types, landscape elements and landscape components of the urban park promoting physiological and psychological restoration","Deng, L; Li, X; Luo, H; Fu, EK; Ma, J; Sun, LX; Huang, Z; Cai, SZ; Jia, Y","Urban parks have been found to benefit human health and well-being. Many studies have addressed the relationship between spatial characteristics and health restoration, but little research systematically focused on specific landscape components. In this study, the effects of three landscape types, six landscape elements and various landscape components of a traditional urban park on psychophysiological activities were investigated using physiological (blood pressure, blood glucose and electroencephalography) and psychological indicators (the abbreviated Profile of Mood States and the Landscape Perceived Restorativeness Scale). The results indicated that: (1) Different landscape types led to different physiological responses and mood states; (2) The topography landscape with natural mountain forest appearance had the most restorative effect; (3) Landscape elements of water, topography and plants had significant positive effects on human perceived restorativeness; (4) Bamboo forest, poetry walls and decorative openwork windows, were ranked as the top three landscape components in terms of perceived restorativeness. These findings suggest that single-item landscape composition can be applied to evaluate perceived restorativeness, and the restorative potential of the area can be reinforced by suitable selection and configuration of landscape types, landscape elements and landscape components in future landscape design. An active intervention approach to the targeted improvement of restorative efficiency in existing urban parks can provide a feasible solution for satisfying the health recovery needs of growing populations.",2020,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,48,,,WOS:000512752000001,10.1016/j.ufug.2019.126488,,#3927,Deng 2020,
"Healthy Parks, Happy People: An Exploratory Study of a County Park System","Frash, RE; Blose, JE; Norman, WC; Patience, M","Happiness is a quality that nearly all people naturally desire. Happiness has been shower to have a host of positive features, including enhanced mental and physical health, more satisfactory relationships, increased earning potential, and even longer life. Park and recreation facilities have been normatively associated with happiness for over a century, yet research on the relationship of parks with happiness is scant particularly from a social psychological perspective. The literature has primarily dealt with the topic tangentially through investigations of leisure and subjective well-being. Given that park activities and happiness are aspects of leisure and subjective well-being, respectively, this study explored whether applicable relationships were also true for parks and happiness. Four hypotheses were investigated: a) park visitation will stimulate happiness; b) across park activity types, fitness activities will have the greatest impact on happiness; c) the diversity of park activities will be more positively associated with patrols happiness than the quantity of time spent; and d) there will be a positive relationship between park satisfaction and happiness. Field research was conducted with the cooperation of a county park system. Park patrons in three demographically diverse municipalities in a southeast U.S. coastal region were sampled over a seven-month period. Three out of the four hypotheses were supported by the findings, which suggested that leisure's relationship with subjective well-being largely holds for parks and happiness. This study's findings indicate that humans' innate desire for happiness may be fulfilled when visiting a park. Patrons indicated that they were happy during their park visit and even happier at the end of it. No particular park activity promoted more happiness than another. Study results propose that happiness is not necessarily augmented as much through additional time spent hut, instead, by engaging in a greater diversity of park activities dining a visit. Patrons generally reported being satisfied with the county parks. Also, patrons left the park happier when they were more pleased with its operation. This has positive implications for park management because happiness is a key component of quality of life, the improvement of which is central to the mission of many urban parks. Park management can leverage this mission success to cultivate greater public trust and support, which is instrumental to securing funding a critical issue for park and recreation departments across the nation.",2016,,JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION,34,1,84-102,WOS:000414001700006,10.186661.1PRA-2016-V34-11-6801,,#3963,Frash 2016,
Humanization of nature: Testing the influences of urban park characteristics and psychological factors on collegers' perceived restoration,"Li, X; Zhang, X; Jia, T","Previous studies have mainly focused on the independent role of landscape characteristics or preference on psychological restoration respectively. However, few studies have explored the complex relationships between restorative effects, landscape characteristics, preference and place bonding factors, particularly in urban parks. The development of new data environment and technique methods enables such a synthesis of innovative approach to reveal the influences of urban park characteristics and various psychological factors on collegers' perceived restoration. A typical urban park in Wuhan, China, was selected for pilot study, in which 1560 crowdsourced images were collected using the Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) tool. With the help of Deep Learning techniques, landscape characteristics were combined with perceptual factors for the Partial Least Squares (PLS) based statistical analysis. It was found that some landscape properties, such as vegetation and water, presented indirect impacts in activating restoration via psychological mediators. The mediating effect of sense of place and the moderating effects of landscape characteristics on the preference -restoration nexus were revealed. These findings shed new light on the complex process in environmental restoration in which psychological and physical factors are intertwined.

The effect of randomised exposure to different types of natural outdoor environments compared to exposure to an urban environment on people with indications of psychological distress in Catalonia,"Triguero-Mas, M; Gidlow, CJ; Martinez, D; de Bont, J; Carrasco-Turigas, G; Martinez-Iniguez, T; Hurst, G; Masterson, D; Donaire-Gonzalez, D; Seto, E; Jones, MV; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ","IntroductionExperimental studies have reported associations between short-term exposure to natural outdoor environments (NOE) and health benefits. However, they lack insight into mechanisms, often have low external and ecological validity, and have rarely focused on people with some psycho-physiological affection. The aim of this study was to use a randomized, case-crossover design to investigate: (i) the effects of unconstrained exposure to real natural and urban environments on psycho-physiological indicators of people with indications of psychological distress, (ii) the possible differential effects of 30 and 30+ 180 minutes exposures, and (iii) the possible mechanisms explaining these effects.Material and methodsPeople (n = 26) with indications of psychological distress were exposed to green (Collserola Natural Park), blue (Castelldefels beach) and urban (Eixample neighbourhood) environments in Catalonia. They were exposed to all environments in groups for a period of 30+180 minutes between October 2013 and January 2014. During the exposure period, participants were instructed to do what they would usually do in that environment. Before, during (at 30 and 30+180 minutes) and after each exposure, several psycho-physiological measures were taken: mood (measured as Total Mood Disturbance, TMD), attention capacity (measured as backwards digit-span task), stress levels (measures as salivary cortisol), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, autonomous nervous system (assessed as heart rate variability and the indicators: low frequency power (LF), high frequency power (HF), ratio between LF and HF (LF: HF), and coefficients of component variance of LF, HF, and LF: HF). We also measured several potential mediators: air pollution, noise, physical activity, social interactions, and self-perceived restoration experience.ResultsWhen compared with responses to urban environment, we found statistically significantly lower TMD [-4.78 (-7.77, -1.79) points difference], and salivary cortisol [-0.21 (-0.34, -0.08) log nmol/L] in the green exposure environment, and statistically significantly lower TMD [-4.53 (-7.57, -1.49) points difference], and statistically significant favourable changes in heart rate variability indicators (specifically LF: HF and CCV-LF: HF with around -0.20 points of difference of the indicators) in the blue exposure environment. Physical activity and self-perceived restoration experience partially mediated the associations between NOE and TMD. Physical activity and air pollution partially mediated the associations between NOE and heart rate variability.Discussion and conclusionsThis study extends the existing evidence on the benefits of NOE for people's health. It also suggests NOE potential as a preventive medicine, specifically focusing on people with indications of psychological distress.",2017,,PLOS ONE,12,3,,WOS:000395983500031,10.1371/journal.pone.0172200,,#4004,Triguero-Mas 2017,

Exploring the Relationship between Urban Quiet Areas and Perceived Restorative Benefits,"Payne, SR; Bruce, N","To help mitigate the adverse health impacts of environmental noise, European cities are recommended to identify urban quiet areas for preservation. Procedures for identifying urban quiet areas vary across cities and between countries, and little is known of the strength of the salutogenic (health-promoting) benefits they may provide. Taking a multi-site approach, this study examines the potential of three sites as urban quiet areas and their associated health benefits, particularly in relation to perceived restorative benefits. Across three cities in the United Kingdom, an urban garden, urban park, and an urban square had sound pressure levels measured. Responses from 151 visitors to these sites evaluated the place as quiet, calm, and tranquil, and assessed their experience of the place in terms of perceived sounds, its benefits, how it made them feel, and perceived restoration. Depending on the criteria used, the sites varied in their suitability as urban quiet areas, although all provided perceived health benefits. Relationships between sound levels (subjective and objective) and perceived restoration were not linear, with the type of sounds heard and other aspects of the place experience believed to affect the relationship. Building on this work, a future experimental approach based on the study sites is planned to manipulate the multiple variables involved. This will provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between urban quiet areas and perceived restorative benefits.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,9,,WOS:000469517300136,10.3390/ijerph16091611,,#4017,Payne 2019,
Management Effectiveness of a Secondary Coniferous Forest for Landscape Appreciation and Psychological Restoration,"Takayama, N; Fujiwara, A; Saito, H; Horiuchi, M","We investigated the influence of forest management on landscape appreciation and psychological restoration in on-site settings by exposing respondents to an unmanaged, dense coniferous (crowding) forest and a managed (thinned) coniferous forest; we set the two experimental settings in the forests of the Fuji Iyashinomoroi Woodland Study Center. The respondents were individually exposed to both settings while sitting for 15 min and were required to answer three questionnaires to analyze the psychological restorative effects before and after the experiment (feeling (the Profile of Mood States), affect (the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), and subjective restorativeness (the Restorative Outcome Scale). To compare landscape appreciation, they were required to answer another two questionnaires only after the experiment, for scene appreciation (the semantic differential scale) and for the restorative properties of each environment (the Perceived Restorativeness Scale). Finally, we obtained these findings: (1) the respondents evaluated each forest environment highly differently and evaluated the thinned forest setting more positively; (2) the respondents' impressions of the two physical environments did not appear to be accurately reflected in their evaluations; (3) forest environments have potential restorative effects whether or not they are managed, but these effects can be partially enhanced by managing the forests.",2017,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,14,7,,WOS:000407370700132,10.3390/ijerph14070800,,#4026,Takayama 2017,
Urban Gardening and Wellbeing in Pandemic Era: Preliminary Results from a Socio-Environmental Factors Approach,"Harding, D; Lukman, KM; Jingga, M; Uchiyama, Y; Quevedo, JMD; Kohsaka, R","The nature and impacts of living in urban settings are gaining their saliences in developed and developing countries alike, particularly during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the crisis, the wellbeing of urban society became intertwined with a so-called ""new lifestyle"", which involved quarantine and working in a home environment. Facing such challenges, urban gardening is deemed as an alternative intervention to enhance residents' wellbeing and the environmental sustainability of urban areas, including Indonesian cities. A preliminary study was conducted to monitor the wellbeing of urban gardening practitioners, as well as investigate the motivation and any association between gardening and wellbeing with the COVID-19 pandemic situation by analysing data from Indonesian metropolitan areas. The study utilized instruments of ""satisfaction with life scale (SWLS)"" and ""scale of positive and negative experience (SPANE)"" to investigate the subjective wellbeing of 67 respondents. Amongst others, we identified that urban gardening practitioners tend to be in positive moods and have better overall wellbeing; 52.24% of the respondents were highly satisfied with their life. Furthermore, we observed a variety of motivations to start gardening, with hobby and utilization of free space as prominent reasons, followed by other motivations such as environmental benefit and aesthetic.

The impact of gardening on mental resilience in times of stress: A case study during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore,"Sia, A; Tan, PY; Wong, JCM; Araib, S; Ang, WF; Er, KBH","To curb the spread of Covid-19, Singapore, like other cities, had to impose movement restriction and social distancing measures that may affect the well-being of its residents. In this paper, we assessed the potential benefits of gardening on the mental well-being of Singapore residents, based on the concept of mental resilience. We hypothesized that gardening activities promote mental resilience. A survey was administered on 8,786 participants of a ""Gardening with Edibles"" programme, measuring their mental resilience status, engagement in gardening activities and socio-demographic information. The mental resilience scores of participants who engaged in weekly gardening were compared with the scores derived from another survey conducted during the pandemic on an online community comprising demographically representative respondents with an interest on Covid-19 related community care. The results showed that the mental resilience of those who gardened was statistically significantly higher than the online community. Within the gardening group, those with less than one hour of weekly gardening time had significantly lower scores in their total mental resilience, and five out of seven resilience factors, ""emotional regulation"", ""relationship"", ""confidence"", ""positive thinking"" and ""spirituality"", compared to those with more weekly gardening time, showing that the efficacy of the mediating effects may peak at a weekly gardening time of between one to four hours.

In a crossover experimental design, 24 university students performed a task transferring pots with and without a foliage plant for 3 min. HRV and oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration in the prefrontal cortex were continuously measured. Immediately thereafter, subjective evaluation of emotions was performed using a modified semantic differential (SD) method and a profile of mood state questionnaire (POMS). Results showed that the natural logarithmic (ln) ratio of low frequency/high frequency, as an estimate of sympathetic nerve activity, was significantly lower while performing the task with foliage plants for the average 3 min measurement interval. Oxy-Hb concentration in the left prefrontal cortex showed a tendency to decrease in the 2-3 min interval in the task with foliage plants compared to the task without plants. Moreover, significant psychological relaxation according to POMS score and SD was demonstrated when the task involved foliage plants. In conclusion, the task involving foliage plants led to more physiological and psychological relaxation compared with the task without foliage plants.",2017,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,14,9,,WOS:000411574400139,10.3390/ijerph14091087,,#4199,Park 2017,
"A nature-based health intervention at a military healthcare center: a randomized, controlled, cross-over study","Ameli, R; Skeath, P; Abraham, PA; Panahi, S; Kazman, JB; Foote, F; Deuster, PA; Ahmad, N; Berger, A","We describe a mixed qualitative and quantitative research study in a military facility regarding the role of nature in well-being. Study intervention included two 20-minute walks. One walk was in an intentionally designed woodland environment (Green Road) and the other was on a busy campus road in a medical treatment facility (Urban Road). Twelve volunteers from a military facility participated in both walks in a cross-over experimental design. The two walking sessions were randomly ordered and preceded by pre-walk instructions appropriate to each road's characteristics and incorporated focused attention and present moment orientation. A semi-structured post-walk interview, the primary outcome, was conducted after the conclusion of each walk. Qualitative data analyses consisted of sentiments and themes by using NVivo 12 software. The Green Road was unanimously rated as positive (100%). Responses to Urban Road were evenly distributed among positive (33.3%), negative (33.3%), and neutral/mixed (33.3%) sentiments. The Green Road yielded predominantly positive themes such as enjoyment of nature, relaxation, and feelings of privacy and safety. Urban Road produced significantly more negative themes such as concerns for safety, dislike of noise and other noxious experiences. Quantitative assessment of distress and mindfulness with Distress Thermometer (DT) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-state version (MAAS) demonstrated that a walk on the Green Road significantly decreased distress and increased mindfulness compared to a walk on the Urban Road. We also observed that pre-walk instructions could direct attention to both obvious and subtle elements of experience and enhance awareness. Results support the notion that an intentional nature-based environment may produce significantly more positive experiences and result in health-promoting benefits in a military health-care setting compared to an urban environment. Future studies with clinical populations could advance our understanding of the healing value of nature-based interventions. The impact of intentional green environments may be enhanced by well-designed instructions for both recreational and therapeutic use.",2021,,PEERJ,9,,,WOS:000605102900004,10.7717/peerj.10519,,#4255,Ameli 2021,
Measuring connectedness to nature in preschool children in an urban setting and its relation to psychological functioning,"Sobko, T; Jia, ZZ; Brown, G","BackgroundThe urban environment has been criticized for promoting 'nature-deficit' and 'child-nature disconnectedness'. Keeping in mind the importance of nature exposure and its extensive health benefits, many environmental programs around the world hope to (re) connect children with nature. To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, valid tools to measure Connectedness to Nature (CN) are needed but do not exist today, especially for use with preschoolers.MethodsThe original CN Index was modified and tested among the Parents of Preschool Children (CNI-PPC) in an urban setting (Hong Kong) for its internal consistency (n = 299) and external validity (n = 194). The 'Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire' (SDQ) was chosen for divergent and convergent analysis. Conventional recommendations for test adaptation and translation were used.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that the 16-item scale adequately captured four major dimensions: enjoyment of nature, empathy for nature, responsibility toward nature, and awareness of nature (Cronbach's alpha were respectively .86, .87, .75 and .80). When tested against the SDQ, a validated measure for child psychological functioning, and identification of children's problem behaviours, three CNI-PPC factors influenced the SDQ outcomes: (1) the more enjoyment of nature children displayed the less overall distress and impairment they exhibited (beta = -.64); (2) greater responsibility toward nature in children was associated with less hyperactivity (beta = -.50), fewer behavioural and peer difficulties (beta = -.62 and beta = -.65 respectively) and improved prosocial behaviour (beta = .77); (3) the more aware children were of nature, the less emotional difficulties they exhibited (beta = -. 51). The variance explained was large (range R-2 = .42 to .80).ConclusionsThus, CNI-PPC factors have meaningful and substantive associations with the strengths and difficulties parents perceive in their children. This indicates that the CNI-PPC is a valid and reliable instrument to measure CN at an age when children cannot respond for themselves. Further, this simple tool can help researchers/practitioners to better understand how connectedness to nature affects child psychological functioning and wellbeing.",2018,,PLOS ONE,13,11,,WOS:000451763800022,10.1371/journal.pone.0207057,,#4306,Sobko 2018,
"The relationship between self-reported exposure to greenspace and human stress in Baltimore, MD","Hazer, M; Formica, MK; Dieterlen, S; Morley, CP","Cross-sectional methods were utilized to investigate if greenspace (GS) exposure predicts stress, a known factor affecting health outcomes. Data included publicly accessible Community Statistical Area (CSA) level information and survey (mailed and online) results of residents in Baltimore, Maryland. The convenience sample was recruited in spring 2013 using random (by CSA) and snowball techniques. The survey included demographic information, GS exposure, recent stressful life events, and the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Individuals reported (hours per week, type) where they see (visual exposure) or spend time in (physical exposure) GS around their home, work and/or school, and during recreation. Duration of GS exposure was defined as hours of visual exposure, hours of physical exposure, and total hours of exposure (both visual and physical). Multivariable linear regression assessed the effect of GS on perceived stress. Respondents (N = 323) reported a mean 25.5 total hours/week exposed to GS. Mean PSS scores were 15.75 for females and 13.45 for males. Controlling for all covariates, there was a statistically significant reduction in PSS score (0.049, p = 0.007) for every hour/week exposed to GS. This means that an individual who spent 25.5 h/week exposed to GS would have a PSS score 3.1% lower than those who were not exposed to GS. Total hours/week exposed to GS, and the individual effects of visual and physical exposure were all statistically significant. These findings indicate the stress reducing effects of GS exposure may be part of complex set of factors behind the relationship between GS and health outcomes.",2018,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,169,,47-56,WOS:000414882300005,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.08.006,,#4339,Hazer 2018,
Greenspaces and Human Well-Being: Perspectives from a Rapidly Urbanising Low-Income Country,"Nawrath, M; Elsey, H; Rijal, ML; Dallimer, M","Compelling evidence demonstrates links between greenspaces and human well-being. However, the existing evidence has a strong bias towards high-income countries. Rapidly urbanising cities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain largely unexplored. The rising prevalence of mental disorders in LMICs highlights the need to better understand the role greenspaces can play in mitigating mental ill-health. We carried out a cross-sectional household survey to investigate links between measures of greenspace exposure and human well-being, and tested pathways that could underpin any such interactions in Kathmandu, a rapidly urbanising low-income city in Nepal. While we found no consistent relationship between measures of greenspace exposure and human well-being outcomes, we provide evidence that greenspaces in a rapidly urbanising low-income setting could be important for encouraging physical activity and fostering social cohesion. Further, we revealed that a medium perceived variety of biodiversity attributes of greenspaces was associated with the highest levels of physical activity and social cohesion. Our findings support the view that greenspaces in LMICs may be less likely to provide well-being benefits. Moreover, medium levels of biodiversity may best promote well-being in LMICs. More research is needed to understand how greenspaces can support human well-being in LMICs.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTS,9,12,,WOS:000901062500001,10.3390/environments9120148,,#5026,Nawrath 2022,

Previous studies suggest that streets are the main activity space for urban residents and have important impacts on human mental health. Existing studies, however, have not fully examined the relationships between streetscape characteristics and people's mental health on a street level. This study thus aims to explore the spatial patterns of urban streetscape features and their associations with residents' mental health by age and sex in Zhanjiang, China. Using Baidu Street View (BSV) images and deep learning, we extracted the Green View Index (GVI) and the street enclosure to represent two physical features of the streetscapes. Global Moran's I and hotspot analysis methods were used to examine the spatial distributions of streetscape features. We find that both GVI and street enclosure tend to cluster, but show almost opposite spatial distributions.

Psychological benefits of Forest Bathing during the COVID-19 pandemic: a pilot study in a Mediterranean forest close to urban areas,"Muro, A; Feliu-Soler, A; Canals, J; Parrado, E; Sanz, A","The practice of Shinrin-Yoku or Forest Bathing is an outdoor therapeutic modality with mounting evidence suggesting positive effects on individuals' psychological wellbeing and overall health. However, its benefits have mainly been studied in Asian biomes and more research is needed to evaluate if its benefits are also generalizable to other regions such as European-Mediterranean forests. To preliminarily explore this issue, 16 healthy adults (87.5% women, mean age 47.5) were assessed before and after a 3-hour session of Forest Bathing with meditation exercises in a Mediterranean forest near Barcelona (Spain). Changes in state anxiety, negative affect, positive affect and state mindfulness were assessed. Results show significant increases in positive affect, vigour, friendship and mindfulness, and decreases in negative affect, anxiety, anger, fatigue, tension, and depressive mood. Effect sizes observed for all the outcomes were significant and large, ranging from d = 1.02 to d = 2.61.

"Effects of forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) on serotonin in serum, depressive symptoms and subjective sleep quality in middle-aged males","Li, Q; Ochiai, H; Ochiai, T; Takayama, N; Kumeda, S; Miura, T; Aoyagi, Y; Imai, M","Background: We previously found that a forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) program significantly reduced the scores for depression, anxiety, anger, fatigue, and confusion and increased the score for vigor in the profile of mood states (POMS) test and showed a potential preventive effect on the depressive status in both males and females. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a forest bathing program on the level of serotonin in serum, depressive symptoms and subjective sleep quality in middle-aged males.Methods: Twenty healthy male subjects aged 57.3 ' 8.4 years were selected after obtaining informed consent. These subjects took day trips to a forest park, the birthplace of forest bathing in Japan named Akasawa Shizen Kyuyourin, Agematsu, Nagano Prefecture (situated in central Japan), and to an urban area of Nagano Prefecture as a control in June 2019. On both trips, they walked 2.5 km for 2 hours each in the morning and afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Blood was sampled in the afternoon before and after each trip. Concentrations of serotonin and lactic acid in serum were measured. The POMS test and a questionnaire for subjective sleep quality were conducted before and after the trips. Ambient temperature and humidity were monitoring during the trips. The Ethics Committees of the Nippon Medical School and Nagano Prefectural Kiso Hospital approved this study.Results: The forest bathing program significantly increased level of serotonin in serum, and significantly increased the score for vigor and decreased the score for fatigue in the POMS test. The forest bathing program also improved the sleepiness on rising and feeling refreshed (recovery from fatigue) in the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA).Conclusions: Taken together, the present study suggests that forest bathing may have potential preventive effects on depression (depressive status).",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,27,,,WOS:000885105500001,10.1265/ehpm.22-00136,,#5878,Li 2022,
Effects of Walking in Bamboo Forest and City Environments on Brainwave Activity in Young Adults,"Hassan, A; Tao, J; Li, G; Jiang, MY; Aii, L; Jiang, ZH; Liu, ZF; Chen, QB","Background. In Japan,""Shinrin-yoku"" or forest bathing (spending time in forests) is a major practice used for relaxation. However, its effects on promoting human mental health are still under consideration. The objective of this study was to investigate the physiological and psychological relaxation effects of forest walking on adults. Sixty participants (50% males; 50% females) were trained to walk 15-minute predetermined courses in a bamboo forest and a city area (control). The length of the courses was the same to allow comparison of the effects of both environments. Blood pressure and EEG results were measured to assess the physiological responses and the semantic differential method (SDM) and STAI were used to study the psychological responses. Blood pressure was significantly decreased and variation in brain activity was observed in both environments. The results of the two questionnaires indicated that walking in the bamboo forest improves mood and reduces anxiety. Moreover, the mean meditation and attention scores were significantly increased after walking in a bamboo forest.

Relationship between psychological responses and physical environments in forest settings,"Park, BJ; Furuya, K; Kasetani, T; Takayama, N; Kagawa, T; Miyazaki, Y","The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between psychological responses to forest and urban environmental settings and the physical variables that characterize these environments, by examining the psychological responses of 168 subjects to their physical environment. Field experiments were conducted in 14 forests and 14 urban areas across Japan. The semantic differential (SD) method was employed in which a questionnaire was administered to subjects prior to their walks in the forests and urban areas. In addition, the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire was administered before and after the walks, as well as before and after they sat and viewed the forest and urban landscapes. The environmental variables measured were air temperature, relative humidity, radiant heat, wind velocity, and two indices of thermal comfort [predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD)]. Responses to the SD questionnaire indicated that compared to urban settings, forest settings are perceived as being significantly more enjoyable, friendly, natural, and sacred. The POMS measures of tension and anxiety (T-A), depression and dejection (D). anger and hostility (A-H), vigor (V), confusion (C), fatigue (F), and total mood disturbance (TMD) showed significant differences between the forests and urban areas. These results strongly support the suggestion that forest settings have attention restoration effects. The psychological responses to physical environments were also significantly related to air temperature, relative humidity, radiant heat, wind velocity, PMV, and PPD.

The Effect of Recreation in a Snow-Covered Forest Environment on the Psychological Wellbeing of Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Study,"Bielinis, E; Lukowski, A; Omelan, A; Boiko, S; Takayama, N; Grebner, DL","Forest recreation can be successfully conducted for the purpose of psychological relaxation, as has been proven in previous scientific studies. During the winter in many countries, when snow cover occurs frequently, forest recreation (walking, relaxation, photography, etc.) is common. Nevertheless, whether forest therapy conducted in a forest environment with a snow cover will also have a positive effect on psychological indicators remains unknown. Furthermore, male subjects frequently participate in forest therapy experiments, whereas females are rarely involved. Thus, in this study, the effectuality of forest recreation during winter and with snow cover was tested on 32 young females. For these reasons, the experiment involved 15 min periods of relaxation in a forest environment or in an urban street environment, in addition to a pre-test under indoor conditions (randomized controlled study). Four psychological questionnaires Profile of Mood States (POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS)) were administered to participants before and after interventions. Results showed that participants' levels of negative mood, as measured by different aspects of the POMS questionnaire (tension/anxiety, anger/hostility, depression/dejection, confusion, and fatigue), decreased after exposure to the forest environment. In contrast, both tension/anxiety and anger/hostility increased in the urban street environment. The indicator of negative affect from the PANAS questionnaire also increased after exposure to the urban street environment, whereas the indicator of positive affect based on PANAS was higher in the forest environment than in the urban street environment. Restorativeness and subjective vitality exhibited higher values after exposure to the forest environment in comparison to those from the control and pre-test. The changes in these indicators demonstrate that forest recreation in the snow during winter can significantly increase psychological relaxation in females, as well as show that recreation can be successfully conducted under these winter conditions.",2019,,FORESTS,10,10,,WOS:000498395600004,10.3390/f10100827,,#6750,Bielinis 2019,

However, few studies have compared the direct effects of exercise to those of meditative activity in a forest and indoors. This study aimed to identify how the effects of the same activity might differ when performed in a forest as opposed to indoors, as well as how the effects of meditative and athletic activities in the same environment might differ. We recruited 139 females between 18 and 25 years of age and distributed the subjects into four groups by random allocation: athletic walking in the gymnasium (AG), athletic walking in the forest (AF), meditative walking in the gymnasium (MG), and meditative walking in the forest (MF). We evaluated the subjects before and after walking, using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-X, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Happiness Index for Koreans.

"Exploring the Association between Neighborhood Blue Space and Self-Rated Health among Elderly Adults: Evidence from Guangzhou, China","Chen, YJ; Yuan, Y; Zhou, YQ","Blue spaces is associated with self-rated health (SRH), but little is known about the pathways underlying this association among Chinese urban elderly individuals. Based on neighborhood effect theory, this study examined the relationship between neighborhood blue spaces and SRH among elderly individuals using data from a questionnaire survey conducted in Guangzhou, remote sensing images, street views, and environmental information in the context of a Chinese megacity. In addition, multilevel linear model and mediating effect model empirical analyses were performed. Results showed that first, the SRH of the elderly was associated with individual- and neighborhood-level factors. Second, the multilevel mediation model revealed that multiple biopsychosocial pathways existed between neighborhood blue spaces and the SRH of the elderly, specifically, the blue space characteristics related to the SRH of the elderly via the mediating effect of stress. Third, owing to demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status, the stratified analyses also indicated a strong association between neighborhood blue spaces and SRH outcomes in the older and low-income groups. The mediating effect of stress in the age and income groups was also observed, and the mediation pathways and group differences were confirmed in the context of Chinese cities.

"Relation between Psychological Restorativeness and Lifestyle, Quality of Life, Resilience, and Stress-Coping in Forest Settings","Takayama, N; Morikawa, T; Bielinis, E","Previous research has mainly dealt with the physiological and psychological restorative effects of the forest environment. However, comparatively few studies have focused on how the traits and attributes of individuals (individual traits) affect the restorative effects of the forest environment. In this study, we examined the relationships between the psychological restorative effects offered by perceived restorativeness of outdoor settings and the individual traits. Then, we investigated the relationships between the restorative indicators that are useful in examining the restorative properties (i.e., the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS); seven indicators in total), the psychological restorative effect (Profile of Mood States (POMS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS); 10 indicators in total), and the individual trait indicators that could be used to investigate individual traits (Development of Health and Life Habit Inventory for lifestyle, Lazarus-type Stress Coping Inventory for stress coping, World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment 26 for quality of life (QOL), and Sukemune-Hiew Resilience test for resilience; 28 indicators in total) in forest and urban settings. Respondents consisted of 46 male students in their twenties. A short-term experiment was conducted using the same method in both environmental settings. We then analyzed the intrinsic restorative properties and the restorative effects of the settings and referred to prior research to determine the restorative effects. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between the restorative indicators and the individual trait indicators by correlation analysis and multiple regression (step-wise) analysis. These new findings were obtained: (1) the forest setting was a restorative environment with a higher restorative effect than the urban setting; (2) although the forest setting had a higher restorative effect than the urban setting, and the influence of individual traits was small; (3) in the forest setting, the relationship between the restorative indicators and individual traits indicators were arranged; (4) distancing (Stress coping), psychological health (QOL), and satisfaction with living environment (QOL) were likely important indicators that are related to the restorative effects in the forest setting.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,8,,WOS:000467747100149,10.3390/ijerph16081456,,#7049,Takayama 2019,

Comparing the impact of forest walking and forest viewing on psychological states,"Kobayashi, H; Ikei, H; Song, C; Kagawa, T; Miyazaki, Y","The impact on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) of both walking in forest environments and viewing forest landscapes has already been demonstrated in previous research conducted by the authors of this paper. In both walking and viewing, decreases in tension-anxiety (T-A), depression-dejection (D), anger-hostility (A-H), fatigue (F), and confusion (C) were observed and an increase in vigor (V) was observed in forest environments when compared to urban environments. Walking and viewing exhibited similar tendencies, however the responses were quantitatively different. This study re-analyzes the POMS scores of 57 young Japanese women with specific reference to the differences between walking in and viewing forest environments. First, a comparison was made of POMS scores after walking and after viewing. F and C scores were found to be smaller after walking than after viewing, while the V score was larger after walking than after viewing. No significant differences were found in T-A, D, and A-H scores after either walking or viewing. The POMS scores in urban environment also exhibited the identical results. These results suggest that the act of walking has the psychological effect of increasing vigor and reducing some negative emotions, such as fatigue and confusion, regardless of environment. Second, to separate the walking effect from the environmental effect, the difference in forest and urban environment POMS scores was determined for each subject, and comparisons were then made between walking and viewing. The results reveal a significantly larger V score when walking than when viewing. Walking and viewing did not exhibit significant differences in other POMS scores. These results suggest that vigor is more enhanced by walking in forest environments than when viewing forest landscapes.

Benefits of A Three-Day Bamboo Forest Therapy Session on the Psychophysiology and Immune System Responses of Male College Students,"Lyu, BY; Zeng, CC; Xie, SH; Li, D; Lin, W; Li, N; Jiang, MY; Liu, SL; Chen, QB","Forest therapy is a fast-growing treatment approach, as it has the potential to alleviate stressful life events and to improve psychological well-being and physical health. Bamboo forests are widespread in southwestern China. Nevertheless, a knowledge gap on the specific health benefits of bamboo forest (BF) therapy still exists. To explore the psycho-physiologic responses of participants to the effects of BF therapy, 60 male adults aged between 19 and 24, with similar healthy conditions, were selected to participate in this study. A one-group pretest-posttest design was used for the BF sites and the city site (CS) to compare the difference in the psycho-physiologic responses of participants before and after the test. Participants at the BF sites participated in a three-day bamboo forest therapy session, and those at the CS participated in a three-day urban program. Blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured as the physical signs, and the profile of mood state (POMS) questionnaire was completed by the participants for the psychological evaluation. Blood was sampled, and natural killer (NK) activity, the number of NK cells, and the levels of corticosterone, granulysin, perforin, and granzyme A/B in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were measured. All the measurements mentioned above were performed at 08:00 on the first and fourth days within the test. Results indicated that the three-day BF therapy was capable of enhancing positive mood states and also reducing negative mood states in the male participants. The blood pressure and heart rates of the male participants decreased, while the peripheral oxygen saturation increased after the three-day BF therapy session. Furthermore, BF therapy significantly increased NK activity and the number of NK cells and perforin-, granulysin-, and granzyme A/B-expressing cells and significantly decreased the corticosterone level in PBLs in the male participants. The three-day BF therapy session improved the psychological and physiological well-being and enhanced the immune functions of the male college students.",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,16,24,,WOS:000507312700111,10.3390/ijerph16244991,,#7446,Lyu 2019,

The subjects were 12 male university students. On the first day of the experiments, six subjects went to the forest area, and the other six went to a city area as a control. On the second day, subjects went to the opposite areas as a cross-check. In the afternoon, they were seated on chairs watching the landscapes of their given area for 15 min. Heart rate variability (HRV), salivary cortisol and pulse rate were measured as physiological indices in the morning and in the evening at the place of accommodation, before and after watching the landscapes in the field areas. The high-frequency power of HRV of subjects in the forest area was significantly higher than that of subjects in the city area. The pulse rate of subjects in the forest area was significantly lower than that of subjects in the city area. The salivary cortisol concentration of the subjects in the forest area was significantly lower than that of subjects in the city area.

Physiological and Psychological Effects of Viewing a Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward') Orchard Landscape in Summer in Japan,"Igarashi, M; Miwa, M; Ikei, H; Song, CR; Takagaki, M; Miyazaki, Y","The physiological and psychological relaxation effects of viewing a kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa Hayward') orchard landscape were investigated. Seventeen Japanese adult females (46.1 +/- 8.2 years) viewed a kiwifruit orchard landscape or a building site (control) for 10 min. The heart rate variability and heart rate were determined. The modified semantic differential method and the short-form Profile of Mood States were used to assess the psychological effects.

Effect of Viewing Real Forest Landscapes on Brain Activity,"Song, CR; Ikei, H; Kagawa, T; Miyazaki, Y","Benefits related to health promotion by getting closer to forests have received increasing attention in modern stressful society; however, evidence-based research about how our brain activity changes when we stay in a forest environment is limited. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of viewing real forest landscapes on the activity in the prefrontal cortex area of young women's brains. The experiment included 29 women (age: 21.0 +/- 1.4 years) and was executed in five forest and five urban areas. The participants stayed in the forest and urban areas and viewed each view for 15 min. While viewing scenery, they had the oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations in the left and right areas of their prefrontal cortexes measured continuously. Viewing real forest landscapes was associated with a significantly lower oxy-Hb concentration in the right area of the prefrontal cortex than when seeing urban areas. In conclusion, viewing real forest landscapes substantially diminished oxy-Hb concentrations in the right area of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to physiological relaxation.",2020,,SUSTAINABILITY,12,16,,WOS:000579428700001,10.3390/su12166601,,#7556,Song 2020,
Evaluating the relaxation effects of emerging forest-therapy tourism: A multidisciplinary approach,"Ohe, Y; Ikei, H; Song, CR; Miyazaki, Y","Considering the increasing demand for rural areas to play a role in easing stress mainly experienced by urban dwellers, we investigated from a multidisciplinary collaborative approach, i.e., physiological, psychological, and rural business management perspectives, the relaxation effects of forest-therapy tourism, an emerging type of rural tourism, on a group of urban office workers. Also investigated were conditions necessary for a sustainable rural business in Chizu, western Japan. First, the results verified physiological and psychological relaxation effects, which lasted from three to five days after forest therapy, The lasting physiological and psychological effects among those with systolic blood pressure >= 120 mmHg, however, were weaker than in the entire sample. Second, due to the ageing and depopulation of the local community, increasing the number of households that provided home stay services was difficult. In summary, it is necessary to fully integrate scientific evidence to support a viable new rural tourism business. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cross-sectional associations of the amounts of residential green and blue spaces within 1 km radius around the respondent??s home (based on the Urban Atlas 2012), green and blue views from home and green space visits with self-reported use of psychotropic (anxiolytics, hypnotics and antidepressants), antihypertensive and asthma medication were examined using logistic regression models. Indicators of health behaviour, traffic-related outdoor air pollution and noise and socioeconomic status (SES) were used as covariates, the last of these also as a potential effect modifier.Results Amounts of residential green and blue spaces or green and blue views from home were not associated with medications. However, the frequency of green space visits was associated with lower odds of using psychotropic medication (OR=0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.82 for 3??4 times/week; 0.78, 0.63 to 0.96 for ???5 times/week) and antihypertensive (0.64, 0.52 to 0.78; 0.59, 0.48 to 0.74, respectively) and asthma (0.74, 0.58 to 0.94; 0.76, 0.59 to 0.99, respectively) medication use. The observed associations were attenuated by body mass index, but no consistent interactions with SES indicators were observed.Conclusions Frequent green space visits, but not the amounts of residential green or blue spaces, or green and blue views from home, were associated with less frequent use of psychotropic, antihypertensive and asthma medication in urban environments.No data available based on General Data Protection Regulation.",2023,1-Feb,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,80,2,111,,10.1136/oemed-2022-108491,,#8076,Turunen 2023,

We aimed to assess the association between greenness exposure and subjective general health (SGH) and to evaluate mental health status, social support, and physical activity as mediators of this association. This cross-sectional study was based on a population-based sample of 3461 adults residing in Barcelona, Spain (2011). We characterized outcome and mediators using the Health Survey of Barcelona. Objective and subjective residential proximity to green spaces and residential surrounding greenness were used to characterize greenness exposure. We followed Baron and Kenny's framework to establish the mediation roles and we further quantified the relative contribution of each mediator. Residential surrounding greenness and subjective residential proximity to green spaces were associated with better SGH. We found indications for mediation of these associations by mental health status, perceived social support, and to less extent, by physical activity. These mediators altogether could explain about half of the surrounding greenness association and one-third of the association for subjective proximity to green spaces. We observed indications that mental health and perceived social support might be more relevant for men and those younger than 65years. The results for objective residential proximity to green spaces were not conclusive. In conclusion, our observed association between SGH and greenness exposure was mediated, in part, by mental health status, enhanced social support, and physical activity.

Natural Environments??Healthy Environments? An Exploratory Analysis of the Relationship between Greenspace and Health,"de Vries, Sjerp; Verheij, Robert A; Groenewegen, Peter P; Spreeuwenberg, Peter","Are people living in greener areas healthier than people living in less green areas? This hypothesis was empirically tested by combining Dutch data on the self-reported health of over 10 000 people with land-use data on the amount of greenspace in their living environment. In the multilevel analysis we controlled for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as urbanity. Living in a green environment was positively related to all three available health indicators, even stronger than urbanity at the municipal level. Analyses on subgroups showed that the relationship between greenspace and one of the health indicators was somewhat stronger for housewives and the elderly, two groups that are assumed to be more dependent on, and therefore exposed to, the local environment. Furthermore, for all three health indicators the relationship with greenspace was somewhat stronger for lower educated people.

"Restoration in mental health after visiting urban green spaces, who is most affected? Comparison between good/poor mental health in four cities","Grigoletto, A; Toselli, S; Zijlema, W; Marquez, S; Triguero-Mas, M; Gidlow, C; Grazuleviciene, R; van de Berg, M; Kruize, H; Maas, J; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ","Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between green space and health, and one of these is the restoration theory, based on the idea that it is possible to increase mental health and decrease stress visiting a natural environment. The aims of the present study were to understand what activities are most related to restoration and if these are the same for people with poorer and better mental health. A questionnaire was administered in four European cities and data about restoration outcomes, type of activity carried out in green spaces and mental health were collected and analyzed. A cross sectional design was used and total of 3134 respondents participated to the questionnaire. The restoration experience was measured with the restoration outcome score, and the mental health was evaluated with a subscale related to mental health of the Medical Outcome Short Form. Participants were divided in two groups according to mental health score. A multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between mental health, type of activity and restoration. The cities showed a similar trend in the association between restoration and type of activity per-formed in green environment. People with poorer mental health seem to be more sensitive to the positive effect of visiting the green environment and restoration was more evident in these people than in those with better mental health. At the same time, the type of activity was less evident in people with better mental health, and they seemed to be less influenced by the visiting of green space. Green prescription is important for the entire population: people with poorer mental health could have important restorative effects and people with better mental health could continue to protect their well-being using green space.",2023,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,223,,,WOS:000996482300001,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115397,,#8081,Grigoletto 2023,
Social and physical neighbourhood characteristics and 10-year incidence of depression and anxiety in older adults: Results from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam,"Motoc, I; Hoogendijk, EO; Timmermans, EJ; Deeg, D; Penninx, BWJH; Huisman, M","Objective: A growing literature suggests that neighbourhood characteristics are associated with mental health outcomes, but the evidence in older adults is inconsistent. We investigated the association of neighbourhood characteristics, pertaining to demographic, socio-economic, social and physical environment domains, with the subsequent 10-year incidence of depression and anxiety, in Dutch older adults.Methods: In the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed four times between 2005/2006 and 2015/2016, using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (n = 1365) and the Anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (n = 1420). Neighbourhood-level data on urban density, percent population over 65 years of age, percent immigrants, average house price, average in-come, percent low-income earners, social security beneficiaries, social cohesion, safety, proximity to retail fa-cilities, housing quality, percent green space, percent water coverage, air pollution (particulate matter (PM2.5)), and traffic noise, were obtained for study baseline years 2005/2006. Cox proportional hazard regression models, clustered within neighbourhood, were used to estimate the association between each neighbourhood-level characteristic and the incidence of depression and anxiety.Results: The incidence of depression and anxiety was 19.9 and 13.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Neighbourhood characteristics were not associated with the incidence of depression. However, various neigh-bourhood characteristics were associated with an increased incidence of anxiety, including: higher urban density level, higher percent immigrants, greater proximity to retail facilities, lower housing quality score, lower safety score, higher PM2.5 levels and less green space.Conclusion: Our results indicate that several neighbourhood characteristics are associated with anxiety but not with depression incidence in older age. Several of these characteristics have the potential to be modifiable and thus could serve as a target for interventions at the neighbourhood-level in improving anxiety, provided that future studies replicate our findings and provide further evidence for a causal effect.",2023,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,327,,,WOS:000999341400001,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115963,,#8083,Motoc 2023,
Moderation effect of visible urban greenery on the association between neighbourhood deprivation and subjective well-being: Evidence from Hong Kong,"Yang, Yiyang; Peng, Chenhong; Yeung, Cheuk Yui; Ren, Chao; Luo, Hao; Lu, Yi; Yip, Paul S.F.; Webster, Chris","The well-being benefit of urban greenery has been extensively documented broadly, though less is known about its moderation effect on the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and subjective well-being. Some scholars also argued that the inconclusive associations between urban greenery and subjective well-being might be partially attributed to the various measuring methods of greenery and the difficulty to measure visible greenery objectively. In this study, we applied three approaches to objectively measure different aspects of urban greenery, including overall greenery by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), visible greenery by Google Street View (GSV) images, and park proximity by geospatial data. We captured two dimensions of neighbourhood deprivation: socio-economic disadvantage and social fragmentation. Using data from the first wave (2015) of the Hong Kong Panel Survey for Poverty Alleviation (N??=??1752), the association between urban greenery, neighbourhood deprivation, and subjective well-being was investigated with multilevel linear regression models, while controlling other covariates. We found that subjective well-being level was negatively associated with social fragmentation but no socio-economic disadvantages, while positively associated with overall greenery and visible greenery. Additional moderation effect analysis reveals that the negative linkage between social fragmentation and subjective well-being was significantly mitigated by visible greenery. These findings demonstrated the importance of visible greenery in enhancing subjective well-being, especially for residents in deprived neighbourhoods, and offered new insights to support urban planning and public health strategies to create a healthy living environment.",2023,,Landscape and Urban Planning,231,,104660,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104660,,#8085,Yang 2023,
Effects of blue space exposure in urban and natural environments on psychological and physiological responses: A within-subject experiment,"Yin, J; Ramanpong, J; Chang, J; Wu, CD; Chao, PH; Yu, CP","Contact with nature results in a wide range of benefits to human health. Most previous studies have focused on the benefits of green spaces on human health, so evidence pertaining to the relationship between outdoor blue spaces and human health is scarce and inconclusive. Using a within-subject field experiment of 30-minute walks, this study investigated not only the physiological and psychological restorative effects of green space and blue space but also the distinctive effects of incorporating blue space into natural environments and urban environments. Based on the results of the generalized additive mixed-effect models in this study, green space can increase physiological relaxation and psychological restoration and reduce the feelings of fatigue and tension. Blue space demonstrated its potential health benefits; however, the results were limited to greater positive moods (feelings of esteem and vigor) and mental restoration, indicating that its power to promote health and well-being is limited compared to green space. Nevertheless, incorporating water with other environments, such as green spaces and urban environments, resulted in pronounced physiological and psychological relaxation effects. Natural environments containing water bodies were more effective in reducing sympathetic nervous activity than urban environments with blue space. Blue space can override many unpleasant features of urban settings and enhance the health-promoting capacity of urban spaces. Participants walking in urban areas containing water responded with greater positive mood improvement and reported stronger feelings of being away than participants in natural environments containing water bodies. These findings contribute to healthy landscape design by increasing awareness of the restorative value and potential of blue space.",2023,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,87,,,WOS:001068813800001,10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128066,,#8086,Yin 2023,
Associations between the urban environment and psychotic experiences in adolescents,"Bouter, DC; Ravensbergen, SJ; Lakerveld, J; Hoogendijk, WJG; Mil, NHGV","Objective: In 2050 two-thirds of the world's population is predicted to live in cities, which asks for a better understanding of how the urban environment affects mental health. Urbanicity has repeatedly been found to be a risk factor, in particular for psychosis. Here, we explored what factors of the urban exposome underlie the association between urban characteristics and psychotic experiences (PE) in adolescents.Methods: Participants were 815 adolescents (mean age 14.84 years, SD 0.78) from an at-risk cohort (greater Rotterdam area, the Netherlands) oversampled on their self-reported emotional and behavioral problems. We used linear regression analysis to examine the association with detailed geodata on urbanicity (surrounding address density), green space density (high and low vegetation), and mixed noise levels (road, rail, air, industry, and wind power) with PE in adolescents. Analyses were adjusted for multiple socio-economic and parental confounders. Furthermore, we explored sex-interaction effects.Results: Higher surrounding address density and low greenspace density were each independently associated with more PE (B = 0.18, 95 % CI 0.02; 0.34 and B = 0.17, 95 % CI 0.01; 0.32, respectively). High mixed noise levels were only associated with more PE in boys (B = 0.23, 95 % CI 0.01; 0.46). A sex-interaction effect was found for high urbanicity (B =-0.46, 95 % CI-0.77;-0.14) and low greenspace density (B =-0.49, 95 % CI-0.73;-0.11), illustrating that these associations with PE were specific for boys.Conclusion: Multiple characteristics of living in an urban area are associated with more PE in adolescent boys.

Urban greenspace and mental health in Chinese older adults: Associations across different greenspace measures and mediating effects of environmental perceptions.,Yue Y; Yang D; Van Dyck D,"This study aimed to contrast the associations of street view-, land use- and satellite-derived greenspace measures with older adults' mental health and to examine the mediating effects of neighborhood environmental perceptions (i.e., noise, aesthetics and satisfaction with recreational opportunities) to explain potential heterogeneity in the associations. Data of 879 respondents aged 60 or older in Dalian, China were used, and multilevel regression models were conducted in Stata. Results indicated that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), vegetation coverage, park coverage and streetscape grasses were positively correlated with older adults' mental health. The associations of exposure metrics measured by overhead view were stronger than those measured by the street view. Streetscape grasses had a stronger association with older adults' mental health than streetscape trees. Noise, aesthetics and satisfaction with recreational opportunities mediated these associations, but the strength of the mediating effects differed across the greenspace measures.

Childhood exposure to green space - A novel risk-decreasing mechanism for schizophrenia?,Engemann K; Pedersen CB; Arge L; Tsirogiannis C; Mortensen PB; Svenning JC,"Schizophrenia risk has been linked to urbanization, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Green space is hypothesized to positively influence mental health and might mediate risk of schizophrenia by mitigating noise and particle pollution exposure, stress relief, or other unknown mechanisms. The objectives for this study were to determine if green space are associated with schizophrenia risk, and if different measures of green space associate differently with risk. We used satellite data from the Landsat program to quantify green space in a new data set for Denmark at 30??30m resolution for the years 1985-2013. The effect of green space at different ages and within different distances from each person's place of residence on schizophrenia risk was estimated using Cox regression on a very large longitudinal population-based sample of the Danish population (943,027 persons). Living at the lowest amount of green space was associated with a 1.52-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia compared to persons living at the highest level of green space. This association remained after adjusting for known risk factors for schizophrenia: urbanization, age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The strongest protective association was observed during the earliest childhood years and closest to place of residence. This is the first nationwide population-based study to demonstrate a protective association between green space during childhood and schizophrenia risk; suggesting limited green space as a novel environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. This study supports findings from other studies highlighting positive effects of exposure to natural environments for human health.",2018,Sep,Schizophr Res,199,,142-148,,10.1016/j.schres.2018.03.026,29573946,#8202,Engemann 2018,
